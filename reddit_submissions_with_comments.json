        "selftext_preview": "I consider myself to be conservative, however I am open minded to arguments or conspiracies from both sides. Recently, I have seen a big trend in people on reddit and other platforms saying they believe the assassination attempt on Trump was staged. I will admit, after seeing the first picture of his ear, I was quite shocked to see that it almost looked untouched - however, it did look like there was a very tiny scar of some sort at the top of his ear. I tried to reason that it could be makeup at first, but wouldn't he want people to see the damage?\n\nMy question is, if Trump's assassination attempt was truly staged, how could that be pulled off? I get the reasoning for wanting to stage something like that (more engagement from the right, empathy, votes, etc.), but how could that be pulled off? Obviously, people in the crowd were shot, so bullets had to have been fired and there obviously was a shooter. But how do you fake the blood - possible blood pack behind the ear maybe? It just seems wild, almost impossible to me that this could be staged, but I am scratching my head a bit. I would like to hear thoughts from anyone who truly thinks it is fake.",

Sometimes these extremely unlikely outcomes are so hard for people to accept that it’s *easier* to believe in conspiracies like the moon landing being fake or the assassination attempt being staged. \n\nAs much as I detest Trump and his ilk, it seems impossible for this to have been staged. The shooter is dead, a member of the audience was killed. These are facts.\n\nUnless you’re willing to believe that the shooter was willing to go on a suicide mission, the people involved were willing to sacrifice an innocent man’s life in the audience, and the secret service was in on all of it, this was just an extremely lucky (for trump) and unfortunate scenario for the killed innocent man and the country.",

At least.\n\nNow, if the average 13 year old son of the average Texan had taken that shot and missed, that average Texan would have slapped that son right in the back of the head.  Missing that shot, at that range, at that fat of a head is just a mockery of American gun ownership.  It’s outrageous.  But okay.  Crookes was a Yankee so maybe we just chalk up the miss to the ongoing enpussification of the Northeastern American Male.\n\nHere is what is absolutely not believable.  Nobody, not White Feather, not anybody no matter what gear they are shooting, is going to be able to demonstrate the competence to clip Trumps ear with near zero risk.  \n\nA fantastic marksman using the best equipment can repeatedly overlap .223 rounds.  The same fantastic marksman can put those three rounds with a dimes radius of the “x” - *AFTER* they have take shot or two to get “dialed in” and if the “x” is not moving around blathering bullshit.\n\nBut the idea that Trump would trust anyone to make that shot on the first round in those conditions - no. Nope.  Now maybe you could plausibly think the instruction was to go a little to the left and that the guy was such a crap shot that he accidentally hit Trump. Very very unlikely.\n\nI don’t know what frightens me more:  a competent but corrupt secret service that tried to assassinate a former president?  Or a secret service that is indeed so soup to nuts incompetent that what we saw is really what we saw. And that incompetent where I pay 1 out of every 3 dollars I earn and still the government borrows $2 on top of the $1.",

Trump isn't the president, why would helping him with such an insane plot benefit them in any way? Why would they want to help him in that process at all? \n\nThat's a ludicrous level of exposure to federal criminal prosecution for dozens of people for a gain of...what exactly? \n\nAnd this is all aside from the point that such an act requires something that may be completely impossible - for Trump not to open his mouth. He is almost pathological in his tendency to spill the beans and the absolute last person on the planet I'd tell something I didn't want literally everyone else to know. There is literally nothing in his background or personality that makes me think he could be involved in anything more secret than a surprise birthday party (and even that I'd be worried) and not blab about it.\n\nEven stepping into the realm of speculation, if the goal was to get sympathy for Trump via faking an assassination attempt, why not do it with literally any other method? Trump doesn't like looking weak, ok, so why not do a car bomb? Much, much less chance of accidentally killing the person you're charged with protecting.\n\nIf it wasn't staged, that has two possible branches off of it.\n\n* It wasn't staged and it all really happened the way we saw it.\n\n* It wasn't staged but Trump hammed up the injury.\n\nTrump faking the severity of the injury and the blood, again, makes sense if you don't think about it but if that was the case then it means that he either knew ahead of time someone would take a shot at him (which brings back the \"why would the Secret Service allow that to happen?\" question) and just had some fake blood or a sharp object at the ready to fake being shot or else Trump didn't know it was going to happen and just always has some fake blood and a razor stashed somewhere to take advantage of someone taking a shot at him.\n\nBoth of those possibilities, aside from just sounding ludicrous, rely on these things not having been noticed by anyone spending time around Trump and he spends time around very, very chatty people.\n\n---\n\nThe fast fixing of the damage makes sense once you realize that the injury probably wasn't that severe and that Trump can afford top shelf medical care. \n\nI agree that it looks sus but people really need to understand that just because someone benefits from something happening doesn't mean they made that thing happen.",

                "body": "Well... Let me answer your questions... But first, there are some things that you don't understand. You don't \"get the reasoning\" for staging an assassination attempt. The only reason for it is to stir up anger amongst conservatives. The votes are irrelevant because your votes have never mattered in your lifetime! Nobody needs to rally support from anyone, the election has already been determined... Spoiler: Trump wins... and then gets ousted. Vance is your cookie cutter Republican politician like McCarthy, Bush, Nixon... a do nothing puppet! But there is no Dems/reps battle for political control, that's just theater to keep you believing that someone's gonna do something someday! Both sides are working together for the same agenda!\n   How could they have pulled of staging an assassination attempt? Well they did a piss poor job of it for sure, but they can get away with it because they control the media narrative! It's simple: tell people it was real and label anyone who says otherwise a \"conspiracy theories\". Anytime you want to know what is a complete lie... Just look for what the news media unanimously says is the truth without question! Google a belief to the contrary and see how the only things that come up are \"fact checking\" claiming those ideas are false. But Let's look at what was on camera:\n   Trump stood up having 2 long streaks of blood on his face after allegedly being shot in the ear. There is no logical way for that blood to have got there and there being no blood in his hair or on his shirt collar or dripping profusely from the wound in an amount great enough to have caused the streaking to the front side of his face. Don't know if you've ever shot anything or seen anything shot but it doesn't look like that!\n   The alleged gunman fired up to 8 round at 150 yards from a prone position with a clear line of sight in plain view of secret service snipers and hit trump in the ear, killed someone 20 feet in front of trump at ground level (from the shooters perspective) and wounded two others downrange and wide right of trump. From his elevated position on the roof, the shot that killed the guy would have been about 8 feet low and three feet to the right... Or in other words, unbelievably bad shooting! I could have done better blindfolded and shooting over my shoulder behind me! Same with the other shots. But yet, for being the worst shot to ever exist, he gets lucky with one bullet coming less than an inch from killing trump? Doubtful! Even a novice shooter could have put all his shots within a 3 foot circle from that position (which would have still been poor marksmanship! Someone from the highschool rifle club should have easily been able to land the majority of those shots on the target.)\n   3 shots rang out first. My guess is that those are the three that hit targets in the crowd. Live fire is dangerous and somewhat unpredictable but the safe distance for landing a bullet without risking injury to trump or his secret service actors is about 20 feet. While I believe that a  hired mercenary(ies) did shoot 3 people in the crowd killing one (as no tragedy is worthwhile without innocent people dying) ... the crowd did not behave as if bullets were flying into the crowd. And I didn't see the expected reaction to someone being shot in the head in the middle of the crowd either! Generally, people scatter and run whenever bullets fly in their direction! You should have seen everyone in the crowd distancing themselves from the stage.\n   Trump turns his head away from the HD cameras just before being hit. Convenient since you can't fake a bullet hitting an ear very easily. Trump reached up and clutches his ear as if unsure what just hit it... When in reality, the sound of the bullet whizzing thru the ear would have been unmistakable and the shockwave of the impact would have been nearly deafening for Trump and the natural reaction would have been to jerk the head away sharply and take cover! He's a bad actor.\n   ",

At least.\n\nNow, if the average 13 year old son of the average Texan had taken that shot and missed, that average Texan would have slapped that son right in the back of the head.  Missing that shot, at that range, at that fat of a head is just a mockery of American gun ownership.  It’s outrageous.  But okay.  Crookes was a Yankee so maybe we just chalk up the miss to the ongoing enpussification of the Northeastern American Male.\n\nHere is what is absolutely not believable.  Nobody, not White Feather, not anybody no matter what gear they are shooting, is going to be able to demonstrate the competence to clip Trumps ear with near zero risk.  \n\nA fantastic marksman using the best equipment can repeatedly overlap .223 rounds.  The same fantastic marksman can put those three rounds with a dimes radius of the “x” - *AFTER* they have take shot or two to get “dialed in” and if the “x” is not moving around blathering bullshit.\n\nBut the idea that Trump would trust anyone to make that shot on the first round in those conditions - no. Nope.  Now maybe you could plausibly think the instruction was to go a little to the left and that the guy was such a crap shot that he accidentally hit Trump. Very very unlikely.\n\nI don’t know what frightens me more:  a competent but corrupt secret service that tried to assassinate a former president?  Or a secret service that is indeed so soup to nuts incompetent that what we saw is really what we saw. And that incompetent where I pay 1 out of every 3 dollars I earn and still the government borrows $2 on top of the $1.",

                "body": "Personally, I think a preponderance of all the evidence shows it was a legitimate assassination attemp. But I can also see why it's not a big stretch to believe it was a setup. I don't think it would be nearly as popular if Trump hadn't played up being \"shot in the ear\" when there is ample evidence now that he didn't get hit by \\*anything,\\* he bit his lip when he fell/got tackled by the Secret Service. But the actual argument for it all being a setup is retroactively applied because of what happened after.\n\nYou start with everyone \\*immediately\\* talking about how an attempted assassination was a game winning shot for Trump. The national sympathy for him getting shot at would catapult him to re-election, no doubt about it. Well if that's true, and everyone is claiming that was obvious even before-hand, then why wouldn't Trump \\*want\\* an assassination \\*attempt,\\* if it could be controlled properly? Add to that what appears to genuinely be lax security and defense, especially around an \\*obvious\\* shooter location. Even a police officer who allegely thought someone was up there with a gun just didn't seem all that bothered by it. Then you have Trump so SEVERLY overplaying it over the next few weeks, people got sick of it fast. Especially when it became clear he wasn't actually hurt, and didn't actually seem affected by \\*almost getting shot\\* AT ALL. He didn't suddenly become the wise, reflective leader the media kept hoping for.\n\nAnd lastly, you have consideration of the caveats. Would Trump actually care if someone died in the process of getting him re-elected? Hell, we already have the answer to that. He doesn't give a \\*\\*\\*\\*. He is definitely the kind of person who would sacrifice a supporter to gain sympathy. And for lesser things than getting elected President.",

Trump wore a fake bandage that no hospital would put on.  The FBI knew it was fake because there was no gunshot report from the hospital and Trump refused to give details.  \n\nSo it was fake, but why?  Yes, Trump was shot at, yes, they killed the shooter.  But the shooter missed and Trump faked that he got hit.  That's what is sad.",

When you consider everything you said, plus these facts, a lot of people find the whole thing fishy. If you were going to make a serious attempt, the shooters prep doesn’t show that. If you were going to stage one, he did enough to look serious.",

He comes back up, there's blood coming from his mouth. he wipes his face, the blood smears back along his cheek and to his ear. That seems to be the order presented in this argument, the pics seem to support that, and the various medical and FBI reports contradict, making them useless as a reference.\n\nThe initial report was that he wasn't hit. Then we got contradictory reports that the teleprompter was hit, shattered, and glass hit his ear. Folowed by reports ONLY that the teleprompter definitely did NOT get hit. The people who looked at him have never said anything, which is probably appropriate. Trump has never released any medical report on any of it. Republicans speaking for Trump said both he was and was not hit by anything, or glass, but the important thing was he was shot at. Which is true, he was shot at. I think he was shot at intentionally. But I agree there is sufficient evidence to claim he may not have actually been hit by anything other than a Secret Service agent or the floor.",

Shooter fires, secret service swarms Trump and forces him down (this is what they are supposed to do). Trump either bites his lower lip, smashes his mouth against the floor, or maybe even gets his mouth smashed by secret service; as they are forcing him down. As he comes back up, video clearly shows blood on his lower lip and possibly some blood on his upper lip. He then wipes his mouth, smearing the blood back across his cheek and onto his ear. I doubt he did it with any kind of calculated intent, I think he just wiped blood from his mouth. At some point people started talking about the blood on his ear, and sometime during that period he just ran with it. Or someone told him to run with it. It's plausible, actually seems more likely after the fact than the idea he got hit in the ear by anything, and thus fuels the idea that the whole thing was staged. Which, AGAIN, I doubt.",

The closest we have is being told he was \"treated\" at a hospital...what for was not named. Rep. Ronny Jackson from Texas has said that, but neither has he ever medically examined Trump nor has he ever served as Trump's active doctor other than \"in name only\" for special occassions. He is a politician who held a medical license in Virginia for 4 years in the 90's who has prepared memos and statements for Donald Trump on medical opinions that frequently make ludicrous and even impossible claims. When legally questioned under oath, he has denied ever ever providing medical advice for Trump, let alone examinations or treatment. He has claimed the memos he prepares for Trump are for Trump's use only and mean nothing medically.",

Not great that Bin Laden was in close connections with the U.S before as well. It doesn’t help that the pentagon and building 7 are insanely fuckin sus, it also doesn’t help that the U.S government got insane overreaching power directly after, it funded another perpetual war and it got bush reelected.

They found that the Trump WH controlled the investigation, prevented the FBI from following up on tips, and likely misused information provided to the tip line to protect Kavanaugh, causing many senators to confirm him because they believed a thorough investigation had been done. YOU are misrepresenting the contents of the report.\n\n From the report:\n\nThe report’s conclusions are: First, the Senate’s reliance on the FBI’s supplemental background investigation to inform its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was misplaced. Multiple Senators expressly cited the supplemental background investigation’s apparent inability to uncover corroborating evidence of the allegations against Kavanaugh as a ground for voting to confirm Kavanaugh. Yet the supplemental background investigation was flawed and incomplete, as the FBI did not follow up on numerous leads that could have produced potentially corroborating or otherwise relevant information.\n\nSecond, while President Trump publicly claimed the FBI had “free rein” to take any investigative steps it deemed necessary, the Trump White House exercised total control over the scope of the investigation, preventing the FBI from interviewing relevant witnesses and following up on tips. The White House refused to authorize basic investigatory steps that might have uncovered information corroborating the allegations.\n\nThird, although the Trump Administration and the FBI assured the Senate that the FBI’s investigation was being conducted “by the book,” they failed to disclose that there was actually no “book” at all. The FBI produced no written protocols for supplemental background investigations, saying it was merely acting as the “agent” for the White House in such matters. Although this undisclosed practice of requiring step-by-step instructions from the White House for supplemental background investigations may be appropriate for following up on discrete, relatively minor questions that routinely arise during a nominee’s initial background investigation, it was uniquely inappropriate for investigating the serious, high-profile allegations against Kavanaugh. Not only did this practice enable the Trump Administration to kneecap FBI investigators’ ability to adequately investigate those allegations, but the lack of transparency misled the Senate and the public about the investigation’s thoroughness.\n\nFourth, the FBI’s tip line was not used to facilitate the FBI’s supplemental background investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. On instructions from the White House, the FBI did not investigate thousands of tips that came in through the FBI’s tip line. Instead, all tips related to Kavanaugh were forwarded to the White House without investigation. If anything, the White House may have used the tip line to steer FBI investigators away from derogatory or damaging information.\n\nThe Senators’ oversight inquiry reveals disturbing gaps in the FBI’s supplemental background investigation process for judicial nominees—gaps that enabled the White House to undermine the Senate’s ability to reliably exercise its advice and consent responsibility with respect to the Kavanaugh nomination. While these shortcomings may be relevant only in extreme circumstances like the Kavanaugh supplemental background investigation, Senators, the FBI, and the White House should work together to correct them to avoid a similar episode in the future.",

They don't have burrs or abrasive edges precisely because they are handled. And the SS members jumping on him are doing so to screen him from further shots. Their guns wouldn't have been out, as that just increases the risk of an accident while they dog-pile. So only a small portion of their guns would have been exposed, and mostly handle.\n\nTrump is clearly shown to check his ear right after the first shots. For that spot to then get an accidental cut right after is highly improbable. Blood might not have been immediately obvious, but that doesn't mean it's not there. \n\nThese discussions absolutely reek of motivated reasoning.",

                "body": "Well there is multiple reasons people think that, but I would first like to make it clear I am a Democrat but anyone who thinks this was staged is just plain wrong and saying it for no reason. \n\nFirst let’s bring up the tragic loss due to this incident, and the one reason that loss may not convince people it wasn’t staged is because of one event: J6\n\nJ6 involved in the tragic passing on multiple officers (as we all know) and that brings up the idea of “Hey Trumps caused a attack on our capitol that killed people, why wouldn’t he risk another life?” \n\nIt is genuinely sad that people might believe this claim, because it’s already known that the man who passed did it protecting his family, a very heroic act indeed. Simply put, this man didn’t want to pass, but he sure as heck didn’t want his beloved family members to either.\n\nThe second reason is really easy to understand why people might think this: Trump has just absolutely lost his mind when it comes to this campaign, and I think he himself knows he is probably not gonna win this election. Let’s think about it, why does it seem like he’s already trying to call the election was rigged? It’s because he knows his campaign is being run all over the place and we all know there’s a lot Trump would do for power. \n\nHowever, nobody loves Trump more than Trump loves himself, and I’m positive he wouldn’t risk his own life just to gain in the polls. \n\nIn reality, people just can’t seem to believe Trump anymore after the chaos he has brought upon this country since he lost the election in 2020, and the only thing we can do to fix each of these problems is by turning out to vote in this next election. \n\nThe only thing we need to do this November in order for Harris to win is simply make sure we have the same people who voted for Biden in 2020 to vote Harris now, and if we can’t do that, we need to convince other republicans and undecided voters that Harris is the better option. \n\nSo to sum it up: People think Trumps assassination attempt was staged because he has shown what’s he’s willing to do to retain power, but we all know (at least I hope we all know) that Trump didn’t stage this. However, we all should realize that Trump’s in a horrible place this election, and I want to tell everyone to be aware another storming at a historical monument in our country could happen, and we must prepare for the outbreak and anger to come after this election is over from the MAGAs.",

                "body": "I’ll preface this with saying I do believe it was real, but still can answer your question\n\nFirst is that based on other things Trump has done, this is very clearly something he would be willing to do if he found it politically advantageous. During covid he was reluctant to do anything posing that it was politically advantageous letting people die because it was mostly killing people in blue states/counties (as is expected early in a pandemic since they’re population centers). He also has pushed back on giving emergency aid to blue states and suggested it being a politically advantageous situation. So the point is, it seems like something he would do\n\nYour point about someone dying doesn’t say much, it could be a staged event with a real gun. As with the above point, him and those in his inner circle have been willing to get far more than 1 person killed to push his political ambitions, so even if this was a known risk beforehand, this isn’t something that would be evidence against this I don’t think, you could use a real gun in a staged event\n\nThere was definitely some intent to exaggerate the nature of his injury and hide details. He was very cagey about revealing medical details plus him being 100% after a really short time with a bullet injury is suspicious. Hiding details certainly doesn’t help with trust. Although I personally think this was because the injury was very mild and possibly from debris from something the bullet hit, but really just that the actual injury was very mild and he wanted to play it up.\n\nPeople also find the egregiousness of how obvious the shooter was setting up in plain sight was suspicious. I don’t agree with this point, I’m sure security is complicated and there was likely some “I thought YOU had that area covered” going on. But people do find thus suspicious\n\nI do agree that he’d be willing to do a stunt like this, and he’s actually gone through with getting far more people killed for political gain so I don’t think someone dying for a stunt is beyond him, but I don’t think him or almost anyone would want a real bullet flying anywhere near them, that’s just scary for anyone, plus he didn’t go to outdoor rallies for a while and has since only done so in his little box which doesn’t play well to the “strong man” and “more guns make us safer” narrative, I don’t think these things are things he’d do if it wasn’t real, these seem like genuine precautions to me. \n\nI do think he played up the severity of the injury which wasn’t necessary, the injury isn’t what was scary but rather the near death even if he wasn’t hit, but the hiding details around that definitely didn’t do him any factors for people believing it.\n\nBut the biggest piece I think is just that it seems like something he would do, his main thing he campaigns on is being a victim so it seems like a stunt he’d pull, I think he *would* be down to do something like that, but I don’t think that is what happened",

                        "body": "I'd like expound a bit more on the nature of his injury. It is important to keep in mind that we are talking about an 82-year-old man in poor health- that this man possesses the ability to take an actual bullet to the ear and heal cartilage with no scars or signs of external injury is essentially asking us to believe that he has superpowers akin to Wolverine's healing factor. \n\nBeing that is the real world and not the X-Men comics, we can say that this is not the case, and it takes a certain level of detachment from reality to see his ear- undamaged externally with no signs of surgical repair- and believe his story to be true and accurate.\n\nHowever, that blood came from *somewhere,* but given that there are no signs of external damage and this man is not Wolverine, we can draw a conclusion from that- it wasn't from an external injury, it was from an internal one.\n\nHis eardrum ruptured. He is deaf in his right ear.\n\nEven having a bullet whizz by you at that velocity can cause air pressure gradients in the immediate vicinity, and an object moving at that speed close enough to someone's ear- if the person is a feeble old man- might cause enough of a pressure gradient to rupture their eardrum.\n\nI don't think Trump is lying about being injured, I don't think it was staged; however, I do believe he is lying about the nature of his injury. Him being a feeble old man who is now deaf in one ear puts a dent in his \"strongman\" image he has tried so hard to portray in spite of being a feeble old man. Having a clear disability- like being partially deaf- is naturally not something he wants to let on as being the case.\n\nHe could clear all this up, just release his medical records, redact them as he likes to let it be known what the true nature of his injury was- yet, he hasn't. Strange, defying the precedent and norms expected of public figures who have sustained public injuries. It's like he's hiding something, doesn't want something to be known. What could that thing be?\n\nHe's deaf in his right ear.",

                "body": "The basic idea is that Trump is unhinged enough to have sacrificed his own voters for sympathy points and big headlines to keep him relevant and to lionize his fan base leading to the election since he wasn't doing great. \n\nFactors that those who doubt the assassination attempt point to as being strange include but are not limited to; his refusal to release his medical records even though he's done it before and it's normal for presidents (he's even used the results to make his opponents look worse by comparison during election cycles), in pictures from his rallies and the debate there appears to be no damage to the ear in question, the odds of him turning his head at the exact right second to be missed, the fact that both assassins have loose associations from years ago with the democrat party but have in recent years been Republican, and the fact that in the first attempt he exhibits no fear for his life as he forces his head back up past the secret service who do nothing to gain control over him all so he can have a photo op. He also pumped out merch based on the assassination in a seemingly bizarre and short amount of time. All of which makes it seem that he could have arranged it in the first place with no concern for the civilian cost as long as it boosted his numbers. \n\nThat's also to say nothing of the fact that historically, assassinations have been positively linked to presidencies. Horrible as they may be, the few times that presidents have been assassinated or survived an attempt it's been good for their party. \n\nAbraham Lincoln (Republican) succeeded by Democrat vice president for a year followed immediately by Ulysses S. Grant (Republican) after his successful assassination. \n\nJames A. Garfield (Republican) succeeded by Republican Vice President Chester A. Arthur who served nearly the full term due to Garfield's assassination early into the presidency. Arthur would be succeeded by Democrat Grover Cleveland (the first Democrat president since the civil war) but, the Republican party would make a comeback the next election cycle with Republican candidate William McKinley who's our next entry on this list.\n\nWilliam McKinley (Republican) would be Succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt (Republican) after his assassination. And that leads us into the next entry.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt (Republican) survived his assassination attempt (1912) after having left the presidency in 1909. His successor William Howard Taft was also a Republican and the only reason he lost the following election in 1912 to Democrat nominee Woodrow Wilson was because the Republican vote that year was split between Taft and Roosevelt who's assassination attempt took place during his campaign that same year. \n\nJohn F. Kennedy (Democrat) would of course be survived by his VP Lyndon B. Johnson (Democrat) who would serve as the next president of the United States as was his duty as the Vice president, but would then also go on to secure the following election. Serving roughly 6 years.\n\nRonald Reagan (Republican) would survive his assassination attempt early into his presidency and then go on to serve a second term. He was also immediately followed by George Herbert Walker Bush (Republican). \n\nTrump also compared himself near constantly to Reagan throughout his campaign leading up to the assassination attempt. Notably, Trump's assassination attempt shares another feature in common with Reagan's in that he not only survived, but also those two assassination attempts were the only two with further casualties or injuries. \n\nAll of which makes people a little skeptical about the whole incident and each following incident since just last night after yet another blunder by the former president he's allegedly had another assassin creep up out of the woodwork to be thwarted before they got the chance to attack. Of course that leaves us with two options. Either Trump is using attempted assassinations to boost his favorability in the election any time his chances of victory go down drastically even at the cost of the lives of his own voters, or trump failing and people wanting him dead are just really really common. \n\nAnother note which I think is worth mentioning is that Trump's response to the attempt was wildly different from all those who came before him. \n\nWith Lincoln, Garfield, Kennedy, and Reagan there was never an opportunity for them to say much about the assassinations. Two had been shot in the chest suffering from punctured lungs, broken bones, etc which would have made it difficult to speak. Two had been shot in the head and died immediately or very quickly afterwards. \n\nBut, in the cases of McKinley and Roosevelt, their minds immediately went to protecting their shooters from the mobs that would have taken their life and in the case of McKinley he wanted his wife Ida to be gently informed of the news. \n\nThe opposite was true of Donald J. Trump who's first instincts after being shot were not to disband his crowd for their safety, cooperate with his secret service for their safety, or to call for the safe detainment of his would be assassin, but instead to poke his head and chest back out, grandstand on stage, and to urge his followers to \"Fight!\" Before immediately merchandising the ordeal before the deceased was even cold. America has an ideal for who the president should be. Apparently, that ideal up until just a little while ago included being compassionate to a fault. Something that absolutely cannot be said of the former President.",

His unwillingness to release medical reports, claiming he was shot, but his ear lobe is intact, SS and local police being unusually unwilling to deal with the shooters' suspicious activity doesn't help. He's also not moral enough that a normal person wouldn't think that staging an assassination attack is out of his character. (At the same time, Trump is a natural born bitch so endangering himself, even if just his ear, would be out of character, if it was against someone like Vance or Loomer, that would be in character with Trump).\n\nI believed it was fake for a while, then the more I thought about it the more I realized the kid just was a shit shot, the police are naturally incompetent and cowardly, SS also isn't very good at their jobs, especially Trump ones, and the bleeding is from a scratch of glass because he's on blood thinners (someone as fat and old as him who doesn't move much has to be on thinners) and the earlobe is technically an artery and bleeds more than say a cheek or arm.\n\nBut i understand why people would assume he staged it, but they're giving Trump too much credit, he's not smart enough to pull off a rral one, let alone fake one.",

                "body": ">One reason that people fall for conspiracy theories is compelling stories — conspiracy theories present exciting, fascinating narratives. A second reason is simplified explanations — complex social issues and problems are rarely clear-cut. Conspiracy theories provide people with simplified explanations and someone or something to blame. A third reason is motivated reasoning — believers in conspiracy theories tend to only search for and present information that confirms their theory, and to find far-fetched reasons to dismiss anything that proves them wrong. A fourth reason is a sense of belonging — many conspiracy theory communities provide believers with a sense of connection and purpose that all people need. A fifth reason is cognitive biases — conspiracy theories seem much more credible and compelling than they actually are because they take advantage of common errors in the ways we think. \n\n  \n[https://newslit.org/educators/resources/conspiratorial-thinking/](https://newslit.org/educators/resources/conspiratorial-thinking/)",

Plus the fact that the guy whose whole selling point is \"mean tweets\" hasn't had a single unkind thing to say about the guy who allegedly tried to shoot him.\n\nAnd anyone who thinks Trump wouldn't sacrifice his supporters to increase his chances of winning doesn't understand right wing politics.\n\nBut all that said I don't think it was staged. I wouldn't be too surprised if it was discovered that it was staged but I would definately question how Trump was convinced to go along with risking himself.",

Whether it's a reporter asking him a question he doesn't like or the lawful search of Mar-A-Lago -- which he was given advanced notice of, but still to this day plays victim. He couldn't even shut up about E Jean Carroll after being penalized millions of dollars for it. And yet, we are somehow to believe that he was able to move on from an actual attempt on his life, rather than having him blame the Dems, Biden, Obama, George Soros, etc. etc. every single day for it. Don't you think he would be applying pressure to Mike Johnson every single day to launch 15 different investigations if the assassination attempt was real?\n\nGive me a break.",

US secret service & local law enforcement would have had to be  in on this \"staged\" event. \n* assuming that the crowd member who died in front of his family was willing to sacrifice his life for a staged shooting is ridiculous to begin with. by that logic, everyone on stage behind Donald Trump would also have to be part of the plan & willing to risk being shot. \n\nso just the first point alone absolutely crumbles the idea that this incident was staged by Donald Trump.\n\nbut you know what - people will still believe it was staged no matter what and that's crazy",

When you consider everything you said, plus these facts, a lot of people find the whole thing fishy. If you were going to make a serious attempt, the shooters prep doesn’t show that.

He comes back up, there's blood coming from his mouth. he wipes his face, the blood smears back along his cheek and to his ear. That seems to be the order presented in this argument, the pics seem to support that, and the various medical and FBI reports contradict, making them useless as a reference.\n\nThe initial report was that he wasn't hit. Then we got contradictory reports that the teleprompter was hit, shattered, and glass hit his ear. Folowed by reports ONLY that the teleprompter definitely did NOT get hit. The people who looked at him have never said anything, which is probably appropriate. Trump has never released any medical report on any of it. Republicans speaking for Trump said both he was and was not hit by anything, or glass, but the important thing was he was shot at. Which is true, he was shot at. I think he was shot at intentionally. But I agree there is sufficient evidence to claim he may not have actually been hit by anything other than a Secret Service agent or the floor.",

Shooter fires, secret service swarms Trump and forces him down (this is what they are supposed to do). Trump either bites his lower lip, smashes his mouth against the floor, or maybe even gets his mouth smashed by secret service; as they are forcing him down. As he comes back up, video clearly shows blood on his lower lip and possibly some blood on his upper lip. He then wipes his mouth, smearing the blood back across his cheek and onto his ear. I doubt he did it with any kind of calculated intent, I think he just wiped blood from his mouth. At some point people started talking about the blood on his ear, and sometime during that period he just ran with it. Or someone told him to run with it. It's plausible, actually seems more likely after the fact than the idea he got hit in the ear by anything, and thus fuels the idea that the whole thing was staged. Which, AGAIN, I doubt.",

I could absolutely see our government trying to do something like that just to give us an excuse to go to war. There isn't enough evidence to prove that the government did 9/11 of course so I don't believe they did, I just wouldn't be surprised if it turned out the government was involved",

They funded those terrorist groups years ago, used the military to destabilize the government and allowed them to take full control. Not great that Bin Laden was in close connections with the U.S before as well. It doesn’t help that the pentagon and building 7 are insanely fuckin sus, it also doesn’t help that the U.S government got insane overreaching power directly after, it funded another perpetual war and it got bush reelected. That entire situation is not as black and white as the media portrays it at the very least.",

They found that the Trump WH controlled the investigation, prevented the FBI from following up on tips, and likely misused information provided to the tip line to protect Kavanaugh, causing many senators to confirm him because they believed a thorough investigation had been done. YOU are misrepresenting the contents of the report.\n\n From the report:\n\nThe report’s conclusions are: First, the Senate’s reliance on the FBI’s supplemental background investigation to inform its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was misplaced. Multiple Senators expressly cited the supplemental background investigation’s apparent inability to uncover corroborating evidence of the allegations against Kavanaugh as a ground for voting to confirm Kavanaugh. Yet the supplemental background investigation was flawed and incomplete, as the FBI did not follow up on numerous leads that could have produced potentially corroborating or otherwise relevant information.\n\nSecond, while President Trump publicly claimed the FBI had “free rein” to take any investigative steps it deemed necessary, the Trump White House exercised total control over the scope of the investigation, preventing the FBI from interviewing relevant witnesses and following up on tips. The White House refused to authorize basic investigatory steps that might have uncovered information corroborating the allegations.\n\nThird, although the Trump Administration and the FBI assured the Senate that the FBI’s investigation was being conducted “by the book,” they failed to disclose that there was actually no “book” at all. The FBI produced no written protocols for supplemental background investigations, saying it was merely acting as the “agent” for the White House in such matters. Although this undisclosed practice of requiring step-by-step instructions from the White House for supplemental background investigations may be appropriate for following up on discrete, relatively minor questions that routinely arise during a nominee’s initial background investigation, it was uniquely inappropriate for investigating the serious, high-profile allegations against Kavanaugh. Not only did this practice enable the Trump Administration to kneecap FBI investigators’ ability to adequately investigate those allegations, but the lack of transparency misled the Senate and the public about the investigation’s thoroughness.\n\nFourth, the FBI’s tip line was not used to facilitate the FBI’s supplemental background investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. On instructions from the White House, the FBI did not investigate thousands of tips that came in through the FBI’s tip line. Instead, all tips related to Kavanaugh were forwarded to the White House without investigation. If anything, the White House may have used the tip line to steer FBI investigators away from derogatory or damaging information.\n\nThe Senators’ oversight inquiry reveals disturbing gaps in the FBI’s supplemental background investigation process for judicial nominees—gaps that enabled the White House to undermine the Senate’s ability to reliably exercise its advice and consent responsibility with respect to the Kavanaugh nomination. While these shortcomings may be relevant only in extreme circumstances like the Kavanaugh supplemental background investigation, Senators, the FBI, and the White House should work together to correct them to avoid a similar episode in the future.",

They clearly didn't recover whatever hit him him (\"bullet or bullet fragment\"), so how could they know for sure what he was hit by? \n\n\nThe answer is they were literally just humoring the guy who could potentially be their boss, the same guy who is notorious for vowing revenge on any perceived disloyalty.\n\n\nI think the shooting was real. But the odds of him being nicked so slightly by a bullet that he had *no visible wound just two weeks later* are so low as to be unbelievable. Couple that with the fact that he's never shown a picture of the wound and never had an official medical examination, and he exaggerates everything, and it's obvious that he wasn't actually hit by a bullet.",

Their guns wouldn't have been out, as that just increases the risk of an accident while they dog-pile. So only a small portion of their guns would have been exposed, and mostly handle.\n\nTrump is clearly shown to check his ear right after the first shots. For that spot to then get an accidental cut right after is highly improbable. Blood might not have been immediately obvious, but that doesn't mean it's not there. \n\nThese discussions absolutely reek of motivated reasoning.",

It is important to keep in mind that we are talking about an 82-year-old man in poor health- that this man possesses the ability to take an actual bullet to the ear and heal cartilage with no scars or signs of external injury is essentially asking us to believe that he has superpowers akin to Wolverine's healing factor. \n\nBeing that is the real world and not the X-Men comics, we can say that this is not the case, and it takes a certain level of detachment from reality to see his ear- undamaged externally with no signs of surgical repair- and believe his story to be true and accurate.\n\nHowever, that blood came from *somewhere,* but given that there are no signs of external damage and this man is not Wolverine, we can draw a conclusion from that- it wasn't from an external injury, it was from an internal one.\n\nHis eardrum ruptured. He is deaf in his right ear.\n\nEven having a bullet whizz by you at that velocity can cause air pressure gradients in the immediate vicinity, and an object moving at that speed close enough to someone's ear- if the person is a feeble old man- might cause enough of a pressure gradient to rupture their eardrum.\n\nI don't think Trump is lying about being injured, I don't think it was staged; however, I do believe he is lying about the nature of his injury. Him being a feeble old man who is now deaf in one ear puts a dent in his \"strongman\" image he has tried so hard to portray in spite of being a feeble old man. Having a clear disability- like being partially deaf- is naturally not something he wants to let on as being the case.\n\nHe could clear all this up, just release his medical records, redact them as he likes to let it be known what the true nature of his injury was- yet, he hasn't. Strange, defying the precedent and norms expected of public figures who have sustained public injuries. It's like he's hiding something, doesn't want something to be known. What could that thing be?\n\nHe's deaf in his right ear.",

No more getting away with  random baseless cynicism. We have all seen Trump watch his own supporters die and not give a shit because it helps him.

He comes back up, there's blood coming from his mouth. he wipes his face, the blood smears back along his cheek and to his ear. That seems to be the order presented in this argument, the pics seem to support that, and the various medical and FBI reports contradict, making them useless as a reference.\n\nThe initial report was that he wasn't hit. Then we got contradictory reports that the teleprompter was hit, shattered, and glass hit his ear. Folowed by reports ONLY that the teleprompter definitely did NOT get hit. The people who looked at him have never said anything, which is probably appropriate. Trump has never released any medical report on any of it. Republicans speaking for Trump said both he was and was not hit by anything, or glass, but the important thing was he was shot at. Which is true, he was shot at. I think he was shot at intentionally. But I agree there is sufficient evidence to claim he may not have actually been hit by anything other than a Secret Service agent or the floor.",

Shooter fires, secret service swarms Trump and forces him down (this is what they are supposed to do). Trump either bites his lower lip, smashes his mouth against the floor, or maybe even gets his mouth smashed by secret service; as they are forcing him down. As he comes back up, video clearly shows blood on his lower lip and possibly some blood on his upper lip. He then wipes his mouth, smearing the blood back across his cheek and onto his ear. I doubt he did it with any kind of calculated intent, I think he just wiped blood from his mouth. At some point people started talking about the blood on his ear, and sometime during that period he just ran with it. Or someone told him to run with it. It's plausible, actually seems more likely after the fact than the idea he got hit in the ear by anything, and thus fuels the idea that the whole thing was staged. Which, AGAIN, I doubt.",

They found that the Trump WH controlled the investigation, prevented the FBI from following up on tips, and likely misused information provided to the tip line to protect Kavanaugh, causing many senators to confirm him because they believed a thorough investigation had been done. YOU are misrepresenting the contents of the report.\n\n From the report:\n\nThe report’s conclusions are: First, the Senate’s reliance on the FBI’s supplemental background investigation to inform its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was misplaced. Multiple Senators expressly cited the supplemental background investigation’s apparent inability to uncover corroborating evidence of the allegations against Kavanaugh as a ground for voting to confirm Kavanaugh. Yet the supplemental background investigation was flawed and incomplete, as the FBI did not follow up on numerous leads that could have produced potentially corroborating or otherwise relevant information.\n\nSecond, while President Trump publicly claimed the FBI had “free rein” to take any investigative steps it deemed necessary, the Trump White House exercised total control over the scope of the investigation, preventing the FBI from interviewing relevant witnesses and following up on tips. The White House refused to authorize basic investigatory steps that might have uncovered information corroborating the allegations.\n\nThird, although the Trump Administration and the FBI assured the Senate that the FBI’s investigation was being conducted “by the book,” they failed to disclose that there was actually no “book” at all. The FBI produced no written protocols for supplemental background investigations, saying it was merely acting as the “agent” for the White House in such matters. Although this undisclosed practice of requiring step-by-step instructions from the White House for supplemental background investigations may be appropriate for following up on discrete, relatively minor questions that routinely arise during a nominee’s initial background investigation, it was uniquely inappropriate for investigating the serious, high-profile allegations against Kavanaugh. Not only did this practice enable the Trump Administration to kneecap FBI investigators’ ability to adequately investigate those allegations, but the lack of transparency misled the Senate and the public about the investigation’s thoroughness.\n\nFourth, the FBI’s tip line was not used to facilitate the FBI’s supplemental background investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. On instructions from the White House, the FBI did not investigate thousands of tips that came in through the FBI’s tip line. Instead, all tips related to Kavanaugh were forwarded to the White House without investigation. If anything, the White House may have used the tip line to steer FBI investigators away from derogatory or damaging information.\n\nThe Senators’ oversight inquiry reveals disturbing gaps in the FBI’s supplemental background investigation process for judicial nominees—gaps that enabled the White House to undermine the Senate’s ability to reliably exercise its advice and consent responsibility with respect to the Kavanaugh nomination. While these shortcomings may be relevant only in extreme circumstances like the Kavanaugh supplemental background investigation, Senators, the FBI, and the White House should work together to correct them to avoid a similar episode in the future.",

Days later, The FBI basically said, \"sure, whatever\", by saying he was hit by a \"bullet, or *fragment of a bullet*\".\n\n\nTrump didn't allow them to examine his wound, and he never had an official medical examination. They clearly didn't recover whatever hit him him (\"bullet or bullet fragment\"), so how could they know for sure what he was hit by? \n\n\nThe answer is they were literally just humoring the guy who could potentially be their boss, the same guy who is notorious for vowing revenge on any perceived disloyalty.\n\n\nI think the shooting was real. But the odds of him being nicked so slightly by a bullet that he had *no visible wound just two weeks later* are so low as to be unbelievable. Couple that with the fact that he's never shown a picture of the wound and never had an official medical examination, and he exaggerates everything, and it's obvious that he wasn't actually hit by a bullet.",

Their guns wouldn't have been out, as that just increases the risk of an accident while they dog-pile. So only a small portion of their guns would have been exposed, and mostly handle.\n\nTrump is clearly shown to check his ear right after the first shots. For that spot to then get an accidental cut right after is highly improbable. Blood might not have been immediately obvious, but that doesn't mean it's not there. \n\nThese discussions absolutely reek of motivated reasoning.",

Only difference is he grazed the outer lobe, not tip top, but you can see it clearly doesn’t shred the ear or rip it off. \nThink about a boxer, punching a face, barely catching the cheek bone area, and it opens a slice/cut. It bleeds pretty good, pretty quickly, because of all the blood vessels in the face/head area, and the ear heals quickly. Cuts and such 3-10 days. Heck, even an ear drum perforation heals in 3-7 weeks.",

The fact that half the country believes the federal government is trying to ensure North Carolina hurricane victims die is because of Trump. The US can no longer do anything because half of Congress cares more about not insulting their king and blaming the Democrats rather than improving the lives of Americans.",

Shooter fires, secret service swarms Trump and forces him down (this is what they are supposed to do). Trump either bites his lower lip, smashes his mouth against the floor, or maybe even gets his mouth smashed by secret service; as they are forcing him down. As he comes back up, video clearly shows blood on his lower lip and possibly some blood on his upper lip. He then wipes his mouth, smearing the blood back across his cheek and onto his ear. I doubt he did it with any kind of calculated intent, I think he just wiped blood from his mouth. At some point people started talking about the blood on his ear, and sometime during that period he just ran with it. Or someone told him to run with it. It's plausible, actually seems more likely after the fact than the idea he got hit in the ear by anything, and thus fuels the idea that the whole thing was staged. Which, AGAIN, I doubt.",

They found that the Trump WH controlled the investigation, prevented the FBI from following up on tips, and likely misused information provided to the tip line to protect Kavanaugh, causing many senators to confirm him because they believed a thorough investigation had been done. YOU are misrepresenting the contents of the report.\n\n From the report:\n\nThe report’s conclusions are: First, the Senate’s reliance on the FBI’s supplemental background investigation to inform its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was misplaced. Multiple Senators expressly cited the supplemental background investigation’s apparent inability to uncover corroborating evidence of the allegations against Kavanaugh as a ground for voting to confirm Kavanaugh. Yet the supplemental background investigation was flawed and incomplete, as the FBI did not follow up on numerous leads that could have produced potentially corroborating or otherwise relevant information.\n\nSecond, while President Trump publicly claimed the FBI had “free rein” to take any investigative steps it deemed necessary, the Trump White House exercised total control over the scope of the investigation, preventing the FBI from interviewing relevant witnesses and following up on tips. The White House refused to authorize basic investigatory steps that might have uncovered information corroborating the allegations.\n\nThird, although the Trump Administration and the FBI assured the Senate that the FBI’s investigation was being conducted “by the book,” they failed to disclose that there was actually no “book” at all. The FBI produced no written protocols for supplemental background investigations, saying it was merely acting as the “agent” for the White House in such matters. Although this undisclosed practice of requiring step-by-step instructions from the White House for supplemental background investigations may be appropriate for following up on discrete, relatively minor questions that routinely arise during a nominee’s initial background investigation, it was uniquely inappropriate for investigating the serious, high-profile allegations against Kavanaugh. Not only did this practice enable the Trump Administration to kneecap FBI investigators’ ability to adequately investigate those allegations, but the lack of transparency misled the Senate and the public about the investigation’s thoroughness.\n\nFourth, the FBI’s tip line was not used to facilitate the FBI’s supplemental background investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. On instructions from the White House, the FBI did not investigate thousands of tips that came in through the FBI’s tip line. Instead, all tips related to Kavanaugh were forwarded to the White House without investigation. If anything, the White House may have used the tip line to steer FBI investigators away from derogatory or damaging information.\n\nThe Senators’ oversight inquiry reveals disturbing gaps in the FBI’s supplemental background investigation process for judicial nominees—gaps that enabled the White House to undermine the Senate’s ability to reliably exercise its advice and consent responsibility with respect to the Kavanaugh nomination. While these shortcomings may be relevant only in extreme circumstances like the Kavanaugh supplemental background investigation, Senators, the FBI, and the White House should work together to correct them to avoid a similar episode in the future.",

Days later, The FBI basically said, \"sure, whatever\", by saying he was hit by a \"bullet, or *fragment of a bullet*\".\n\n\nTrump didn't allow them to examine his wound, and he never had an official medical examination. They clearly didn't recover whatever hit him him (\"bullet or bullet fragment\"), so how could they know for sure what he was hit by? \n\n\nThe answer is they were literally just humoring the guy who could potentially be their boss, the same guy who is notorious for vowing revenge on any perceived disloyalty.\n\n\nI think the shooting was real. But the odds of him being nicked so slightly by a bullet that he had *no visible wound just two weeks later* are so low as to be unbelievable. Couple that with the fact that he's never shown a picture of the wound and never had an official medical examination, and he exaggerates everything, and it's obvious that he wasn't actually hit by a bullet.",

Shooter fires, secret service swarms Trump and forces him down (this is what they are supposed to do). Trump either bites his lower lip, smashes his mouth against the floor, or maybe even gets his mouth smashed by secret service; as they are forcing him down. As he comes back up, video clearly shows blood on his lower lip and possibly some blood on his upper lip. He then wipes his mouth, smearing the blood back across his cheek and onto his ear. I doubt he did it with any kind of calculated intent, I think he just wiped blood from his mouth. At some point people started talking about the blood on his ear, and sometime during that period he just ran with it. Or someone told him to run with it. It's plausible, actually seems more likely after the fact than the idea he got hit in the ear by anything, and thus fuels the idea that the whole thing was staged. Which, AGAIN, I doubt.",

                                "body": "The report does not say that they completed their job to the letter and that they just think some new policies should be in place for next time. They found that the Trump WH controlled the investigation, prevented the FBI from following up on tips, and likely misused information provided to the tip line to protect Kavanaugh, causing many senators to confirm him because they believed a thorough investigation had been done. YOU are misrepresenting the contents of the report.\n\n From the report:\n\nThe report’s conclusions are: First, the Senate’s reliance on the FBI’s supplemental background investigation to inform its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was misplaced. Multiple Senators expressly cited the supplemental background investigation’s apparent inability to uncover corroborating evidence of the allegations against Kavanaugh as a ground for voting to confirm Kavanaugh. Yet the supplemental background investigation was flawed and incomplete, as the FBI did not follow up on numerous leads that could have produced potentially corroborating or otherwise relevant information.\n\nSecond, while President Trump publicly claimed the FBI had “free rein” to take any investigative steps it deemed necessary, the Trump White House exercised total control over the scope of the investigation, preventing the FBI from interviewing relevant witnesses and following up on tips. The White House refused to authorize basic investigatory steps that might have uncovered information corroborating the allegations.\n\nThird, although the Trump Administration and the FBI assured the Senate that the FBI’s investigation was being conducted “by the book,” they failed to disclose that there was actually no “book” at all. The FBI produced no written protocols for supplemental background investigations, saying it was merely acting as the “agent” for the White House in such matters. Although this undisclosed practice of requiring step-by-step instructions from the White House for supplemental background investigations may be appropriate for following up on discrete, relatively minor questions that routinely arise during a nominee’s initial background investigation, it was uniquely inappropriate for investigating the serious, high-profile allegations against Kavanaugh. Not only did this practice enable the Trump Administration to kneecap FBI investigators’ ability to adequately investigate those allegations, but the lack of transparency misled the Senate and the public about the investigation’s thoroughness.\n\nFourth, the FBI’s tip line was not used to facilitate the FBI’s supplemental background investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. On instructions from the White House, the FBI did not investigate thousands of tips that came in through the FBI’s tip line. Instead, all tips related to Kavanaugh were forwarded to the White House without investigation. If anything, the White House may have used the tip line to steer FBI investigators away from derogatory or damaging information.\n\nThe Senators’ oversight inquiry reveals disturbing gaps in the FBI’s supplemental background investigation process for judicial nominees—gaps that enabled the White House to undermine the Senate’s ability to reliably exercise its advice and consent responsibility with respect to the Kavanaugh nomination. While these shortcomings may be relevant only in extreme circumstances like the Kavanaugh supplemental background investigation, Senators, the FBI, and the White House should work together to correct them to avoid a similar episode in the future.",

Shooter fires, secret service swarms Trump and forces him down (this is what they are supposed to do). Trump either bites his lower lip, smashes his mouth against the floor, or maybe even gets his mouth smashed by secret service; as they are forcing him down. As he comes back up, video clearly shows blood on his lower lip and possibly some blood on his upper lip. He then wipes his mouth, smearing the blood back across his cheek and onto his ear. I doubt he did it with any kind of calculated intent, I think he just wiped blood from his mouth. At some point people started talking about the blood on his ear, and sometime during that period he just ran with it. Or someone told him to run with it. It's plausible, actually seems more likely after the fact than the idea he got hit in the ear by anything, and thus fuels the idea that the whole thing was staged. Which, AGAIN, I doubt.",

                        "body": "The report does not say that they completed their job to the letter and that they just think some new policies should be in place for next time. They found that the Trump WH controlled the investigation, prevented the FBI from following up on tips, and likely misused information provided to the tip line to protect Kavanaugh, causing many senators to confirm him because they believed a thorough investigation had been done. YOU are misrepresenting the contents of the report.\n\n From the report:\n\nThe report’s conclusions are: First, the Senate’s reliance on the FBI’s supplemental background investigation to inform its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was misplaced. Multiple Senators expressly cited the supplemental background investigation’s apparent inability to uncover corroborating evidence of the allegations against Kavanaugh as a ground for voting to confirm Kavanaugh. Yet the supplemental background investigation was flawed and incomplete, as the FBI did not follow up on numerous leads that could have produced potentially corroborating or otherwise relevant information.\n\nSecond, while President Trump publicly claimed the FBI had “free rein” to take any investigative steps it deemed necessary, the Trump White House exercised total control over the scope of the investigation, preventing the FBI from interviewing relevant witnesses and following up on tips. The White House refused to authorize basic investigatory steps that might have uncovered information corroborating the allegations.\n\nThird, although the Trump Administration and the FBI assured the Senate that the FBI’s investigation was being conducted “by the book,” they failed to disclose that there was actually no “book” at all. The FBI produced no written protocols for supplemental background investigations, saying it was merely acting as the “agent” for the White House in such matters. Although this undisclosed practice of requiring step-by-step instructions from the White House for supplemental background investigations may be appropriate for following up on discrete, relatively minor questions that routinely arise during a nominee’s initial background investigation, it was uniquely inappropriate for investigating the serious, high-profile allegations against Kavanaugh. Not only did this practice enable the Trump Administration to kneecap FBI investigators’ ability to adequately investigate those allegations, but the lack of transparency misled the Senate and the public about the investigation’s thoroughness.\n\nFourth, the FBI’s tip line was not used to facilitate the FBI’s supplemental background investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. On instructions from the White House, the FBI did not investigate thousands of tips that came in through the FBI’s tip line. Instead, all tips related to Kavanaugh were forwarded to the White House without investigation. If anything, the White House may have used the tip line to steer FBI investigators away from derogatory or damaging information.\n\nThe Senators’ oversight inquiry reveals disturbing gaps in the FBI’s supplemental background investigation process for judicial nominees—gaps that enabled the White House to undermine the Senate’s ability to reliably exercise its advice and consent responsibility with respect to the Kavanaugh nomination. While these shortcomings may be relevant only in extreme circumstances like the Kavanaugh supplemental background investigation, Senators, the FBI, and the White House should work together to correct them to avoid a similar episode in the future.",

Shooter fires, secret service swarms Trump and forces him down (this is what they are supposed to do). Trump either bites his lower lip, smashes his mouth against the floor, or maybe even gets his mouth smashed by secret service; as they are forcing him down. As he comes back up, video clearly shows blood on his lower lip and possibly some blood on his upper lip. He then wipes his mouth, smearing the blood back across his cheek and onto his ear. I doubt he did it with any kind of calculated intent, I think he just wiped blood from his mouth. At some point people started talking about the blood on his ear, and sometime during that period he just ran with it. Or someone told him to run with it. It's plausible, actually seems more likely after the fact than the idea he got hit in the ear by anything, and thus fuels the idea that the whole thing was staged. Which, AGAIN, I doubt.",

                "body": "The report does not say that they completed their job to the letter and that they just think some new policies should be in place for next time. They found that the Trump WH controlled the investigation, prevented the FBI from following up on tips, and likely misused information provided to the tip line to protect Kavanaugh, causing many senators to confirm him because they believed a thorough investigation had been done. YOU are misrepresenting the contents of the report.\n\n From the report:\n\nThe report’s conclusions are: First, the Senate’s reliance on the FBI’s supplemental background investigation to inform its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was misplaced. Multiple Senators expressly cited the supplemental background investigation’s apparent inability to uncover corroborating evidence of the allegations against Kavanaugh as a ground for voting to confirm Kavanaugh. Yet the supplemental background investigation was flawed and incomplete, as the FBI did not follow up on numerous leads that could have produced potentially corroborating or otherwise relevant information.\n\nSecond, while President Trump publicly claimed the FBI had “free rein” to take any investigative steps it deemed necessary, the Trump White House exercised total control over the scope of the investigation, preventing the FBI from interviewing relevant witnesses and following up on tips. The White House refused to authorize basic investigatory steps that might have uncovered information corroborating the allegations.\n\nThird, although the Trump Administration and the FBI assured the Senate that the FBI’s investigation was being conducted “by the book,” they failed to disclose that there was actually no “book” at all. The FBI produced no written protocols for supplemental background investigations, saying it was merely acting as the “agent” for the White House in such matters. Although this undisclosed practice of requiring step-by-step instructions from the White House for supplemental background investigations may be appropriate for following up on discrete, relatively minor questions that routinely arise during a nominee’s initial background investigation, it was uniquely inappropriate for investigating the serious, high-profile allegations against Kavanaugh. Not only did this practice enable the Trump Administration to kneecap FBI investigators’ ability to adequately investigate those allegations, but the lack of transparency misled the Senate and the public about the investigation’s thoroughness.\n\nFourth, the FBI’s tip line was not used to facilitate the FBI’s supplemental background investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. On instructions from the White House, the FBI did not investigate thousands of tips that came in through the FBI’s tip line. Instead, all tips related to Kavanaugh were forwarded to the White House without investigation. If anything, the White House may have used the tip line to steer FBI investigators away from derogatory or damaging information.\n\nThe Senators’ oversight inquiry reveals disturbing gaps in the FBI’s supplemental background investigation process for judicial nominees—gaps that enabled the White House to undermine the Senate’s ability to reliably exercise its advice and consent responsibility with respect to the Kavanaugh nomination. While these shortcomings may be relevant only in extreme circumstances like the Kavanaugh supplemental background investigation, Senators, the FBI, and the White House should work together to correct them to avoid a similar episode in the future.",

Their theory is a second shooter from a window.\n\nBut there’s another explanation that I told from the beginning: The kid didn’t shoot to kill Trump, but he was convicted to “help” the secret service taking down “bad people” infiltrated in the crowd.\n\nIt’s been a week and we still haven’t seen any medical evidence that Trump got wounded by a bullet, and the first theory was that he got hit by a flying piece of glass from the teleprompter. In fact secret service got hurt like that, with pieces of metal and glass. \n\nTrump cut his ear knowing that the shooter wasn’t pointing at him but to the crowd. He knew what was as the plan and was prepared with a hidden knife on his right sleeve. In the speech he said that it was blood everywhere but it wasn’t, he said he had blood on his hand, but the videos showed that his hand was clean. \n\nThe angle of the shot that supposed to hurt Trumps ear must be the same that wounded the man in the torso, for that the kid must be on border right side of the roof, but his body and gun was in the center. \n\nI want to see Trumps ear and medical records. \n",

These operations are usually executed by governments, military organizations, or other influential entities. Here is an overview of how PSYOPs are conducted on a mass scale:\n\n### 1. **Strategic Planning**\n   - **Objective Setting**: Define clear, achievable objectives for the PSYOP campaign. This could range from changing public opinion on a specific issue to destabilizing an adversary’s morale.\n   - **Target Audience Analysis**: Identify the demographic, psychographic, cultural, and sociopolitical characteristics of the target audience.\n   - **Message Development**: Craft persuasive messages that resonate with the target audience’s values, beliefs, and emotions.\n\n### 2. **Media Selection and Message Dissemination**\n   - **Traditional Media**: Utilize television, radio, newspapers, and magazines to reach a broad audience. These media can carry news stories, advertisements, or entertainment content designed to influence perceptions.\n   - **Digital Media**: Exploit social media platforms, websites, blogs, and email campaigns. Digital media allows for targeted and interactive engagement, as well as rapid dissemination of content.\n   - **Cultural Products**: Employ films, music, literature, and art to subtly incorporate desired messages into popular culture.\n   - **Influencers and Opinion Leaders**: Leverage the credibility and reach of celebrities, community leaders, and social media influencers to propagate the desired narratives.\n\n### 3. **Execution Tactics**\n   - **Propaganda**: Spread information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.\n   - **Disinformation**: Deliberately disseminate false information to mislead the target audience, causing confusion and doubt.\n   - **Psychological Warfare**: Use intimidation, fear, and uncertainty to break down the morale and cohesion of the target audience.\n   - **Cyber Operations**: Conduct cyber activities such as hacking and releasing sensitive information to create chaos and distrust among the populace.\n\n### 4. **Monitoring and Feedback**\n   - **Impact Assessment**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the PSYOP campaign through surveys, social media analytics, media monitoring, and intelligence reports.\n   - **Adaptive Strategies**: Modify messages and tactics in response to feedback and changing circumstances to maintain or enhance effectiveness.\n\n### 5. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**\n   - **Compliance with Laws**: Ensure that the PSYOP campaign complies with international laws, local laws, and ethical standards.\n   - **Minimize Harm**: Aim to achieve objectives with minimal collateral damage and avoid actions that could lead to long-term negative consequences.\n\n### Examples of Mass Scale PSYOP:\n   - **World War II Propaganda**: Both Allied and Axis powers used extensive propaganda campaigns to influence public opinion and enemy morale.\n   - **Cold War Campaigns**: The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in numerous PSYOP efforts to win hearts and minds across the globe.\n   - **Modern Disinformation Campaigns**: Various state and non-state actors use social media and other digital platforms to spread disinformation and influence political outcomes in other countries.\n\nConducting PSYOP on a mass scale requires meticulous planning, sophisticated understanding of human psychology, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing information environments.",

The proper authoritative investigation hasn’t been completed or released yet, we don’t know if it was the bullet or glass shards from the teleprompter even yet. All I’m saying is it would be easy to fake, Trump has pulled some staged stunts before and he’s in desperation mode right now to win this election, he will do ANYTHING. Side note- Trump was “missing’ several days before this event, maybe in ‘rehearsal’ for this event and his plane was parked next to Putins plane at the airport…coincidence?? Maybe, but with stakes this high for Trump and Putin, the odds go up exponentially that this was a false flag event to try and seal the deal with any MAGA still left on the fence",

These operations are usually executed by governments, military organizations, or other influential entities. Here is an overview of how PSYOPs are conducted on a mass scale:\n\n### 1. **Strategic Planning**\n   - **Objective Setting**: Define clear, achievable objectives for the PSYOP campaign. This could range from changing public opinion on a specific issue to destabilizing an adversary’s morale.\n   - **Target Audience Analysis**: Identify the demographic, psychographic, cultural, and sociopolitical characteristics of the target audience.\n   - **Message Development**: Craft persuasive messages that resonate with the target audience’s values, beliefs, and emotions.\n\n### 2. **Media Selection and Message Dissemination**\n   - **Traditional Media**: Utilize television, radio, newspapers, and magazines to reach a broad audience. These media can carry news stories, advertisements, or entertainment content designed to influence perceptions.\n   - **Digital Media**: Exploit social media platforms, websites, blogs, and email campaigns. Digital media allows for targeted and interactive engagement, as well as rapid dissemination of content.\n   - **Cultural Products**: Employ films, music, literature, and art to subtly incorporate desired messages into popular culture.\n   - **Influencers and Opinion Leaders**: Leverage the credibility and reach of celebrities, community leaders, and social media influencers to propagate the desired narratives.\n\n### 3. **Execution Tactics**\n   - **Propaganda**: Spread information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.\n   - **Disinformation**: Deliberately disseminate false information to mislead the target audience, causing confusion and doubt.\n   - **Psychological Warfare**: Use intimidation, fear, and uncertainty to break down the morale and cohesion of the target audience.\n   - **Cyber Operations**: Conduct cyber activities such as hacking and releasing sensitive information to create chaos and distrust among the populace.\n\n### 4. **Monitoring and Feedback**\n   - **Impact Assessment**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the PSYOP campaign through surveys, social media analytics, media monitoring, and intelligence reports.\n   - **Adaptive Strategies**: Modify messages and tactics in response to feedback and changing circumstances to maintain or enhance effectiveness.\n\n### 5. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**\n   - **Compliance with Laws**: Ensure that the PSYOP campaign complies with international laws, local laws, and ethical standards.\n   - **Minimize Harm**: Aim to achieve objectives with minimal collateral damage and avoid actions that could lead to long-term negative consequences.\n\n### Examples of Mass Scale PSYOP:\n   - **World War II Propaganda**: Both Allied and Axis powers used extensive propaganda campaigns to influence public opinion and enemy morale.\n   - **Cold War Campaigns**: The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in numerous PSYOP efforts to win hearts and minds across the globe.\n   - **Modern Disinformation Campaigns**: Various state and non-state actors use social media and other digital platforms to spread disinformation and influence political outcomes in other countries.\n\nConducting PSYOP on a mass scale requires meticulous planning, sophisticated understanding of human psychology, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing information environments.",

The term is a combination of the words “man” and “explaining”.\n\nHere are some examples of mansplaining:\nA mechanic explaining how to maintain a car to a woman who already knows how\nA friend commenting on an outfit and offering dating advice, even though the woman probably knows more about those topics than the friend \nWriter Rebecca Solnit is credited with identifying mansplaining as a concept in her 2008 essay, “Men Explain Things to Me”. According to a study, mansplaining can have a negative impact on women. \nIf someone is mansplaining, you can try saying “You’re mansplaining me” and then explaining what happened in a diplomatic and pleasant way. You can also try using humor.",

These operations are usually executed by governments, military organizations, or other influential entities. Here is an overview of how PSYOPs are conducted on a mass scale:\n\n### 1. **Strategic Planning**\n   - **Objective Setting**: Define clear, achievable objectives for the PSYOP campaign. This could range from changing public opinion on a specific issue to destabilizing an adversary’s morale.\n   - **Target Audience Analysis**: Identify the demographic, psychographic, cultural, and sociopolitical characteristics of the target audience.\n   - **Message Development**: Craft persuasive messages that resonate with the target audience’s values, beliefs, and emotions.\n\n### 2. **Media Selection and Message Dissemination**\n   - **Traditional Media**: Utilize television, radio, newspapers, and magazines to reach a broad audience. These media can carry news stories, advertisements, or entertainment content designed to influence perceptions.\n   - **Digital Media**: Exploit social media platforms, websites, blogs, and email campaigns. Digital media allows for targeted and interactive engagement, as well as rapid dissemination of content.\n   - **Cultural Products**: Employ films, music, literature, and art to subtly incorporate desired messages into popular culture.\n   - **Influencers and Opinion Leaders**: Leverage the credibility and reach of celebrities, community leaders, and social media influencers to propagate the desired narratives.\n\n### 3. **Execution Tactics**\n   - **Propaganda**: Spread information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.\n   - **Disinformation**: Deliberately disseminate false information to mislead the target audience, causing confusion and doubt.\n   - **Psychological Warfare**: Use intimidation, fear, and uncertainty to break down the morale and cohesion of the target audience.\n   - **Cyber Operations**: Conduct cyber activities such as hacking and releasing sensitive information to create chaos and distrust among the populace.\n\n### 4. **Monitoring and Feedback**\n   - **Impact Assessment**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the PSYOP campaign through surveys, social media analytics, media monitoring, and intelligence reports.\n   - **Adaptive Strategies**: Modify messages and tactics in response to feedback and changing circumstances to maintain or enhance effectiveness.\n\n### 5. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**\n   - **Compliance with Laws**: Ensure that the PSYOP campaign complies with international laws, local laws, and ethical standards.\n   - **Minimize Harm**: Aim to achieve objectives with minimal collateral damage and avoid actions that could lead to long-term negative consequences.\n\n### Examples of Mass Scale PSYOP:\n   - **World War II Propaganda**: Both Allied and Axis powers used extensive propaganda campaigns to influence public opinion and enemy morale.\n   - **Cold War Campaigns**: The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in numerous PSYOP efforts to win hearts and minds across the globe.\n   - **Modern Disinformation Campaigns**: Various state and non-state actors use social media and other digital platforms to spread disinformation and influence political outcomes in other countries.\n\nConducting PSYOP on a mass scale requires meticulous planning, sophisticated understanding of human psychology, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing information environments.",

According to a study, mansplaining can have a negative impact on women. \nIf someone is mansplaining, you can try saying “You’re mansplaining me” and then explaining what happened in a diplomatic and pleasant way. You can also try using humor.",

These operations are usually executed by governments, military organizations, or other influential entities. Here is an overview of how PSYOPs are conducted on a mass scale:\n\n### 1. **Strategic Planning**\n   - **Objective Setting**: Define clear, achievable objectives for the PSYOP campaign. This could range from changing public opinion on a specific issue to destabilizing an adversary’s morale.\n   - **Target Audience Analysis**: Identify the demographic, psychographic, cultural, and sociopolitical characteristics of the target audience.\n   - **Message Development**: Craft persuasive messages that resonate with the target audience’s values, beliefs, and emotions.\n\n### 2. **Media Selection and Message Dissemination**\n   - **Traditional Media**: Utilize television, radio, newspapers, and magazines to reach a broad audience. These media can carry news stories, advertisements, or entertainment content designed to influence perceptions.\n   - **Digital Media**: Exploit social media platforms, websites, blogs, and email campaigns. Digital media allows for targeted and interactive engagement, as well as rapid dissemination of content.\n   - **Cultural Products**: Employ films, music, literature, and art to subtly incorporate desired messages into popular culture.\n   - **Influencers and Opinion Leaders**: Leverage the credibility and reach of celebrities, community leaders, and social media influencers to propagate the desired narratives.\n\n### 3. **Execution Tactics**\n   - **Propaganda**: Spread information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.\n   - **Disinformation**: Deliberately disseminate false information to mislead the target audience, causing confusion and doubt.\n   - **Psychological Warfare**: Use intimidation, fear, and uncertainty to break down the morale and cohesion of the target audience.\n   - **Cyber Operations**: Conduct cyber activities such as hacking and releasing sensitive information to create chaos and distrust among the populace.\n\n### 4. **Monitoring and Feedback**\n   - **Impact Assessment**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the PSYOP campaign through surveys, social media analytics, media monitoring, and intelligence reports.\n   - **Adaptive Strategies**: Modify messages and tactics in response to feedback and changing circumstances to maintain or enhance effectiveness.\n\n### 5. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**\n   - **Compliance with Laws**: Ensure that the PSYOP campaign complies with international laws, local laws, and ethical standards.\n   - **Minimize Harm**: Aim to achieve objectives with minimal collateral damage and avoid actions that could lead to long-term negative consequences.\n\n### Examples of Mass Scale PSYOP:\n   - **World War II Propaganda**: Both Allied and Axis powers used extensive propaganda campaigns to influence public opinion and enemy morale.\n   - **Cold War Campaigns**: The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in numerous PSYOP efforts to win hearts and minds across the globe.\n   - **Modern Disinformation Campaigns**: Various state and non-state actors use social media and other digital platforms to spread disinformation and influence political outcomes in other countries.\n\nConducting PSYOP on a mass scale requires meticulous planning, sophisticated understanding of human psychology, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing information environments.",

According to a study, mansplaining can have a negative impact on women. \nIf someone is mansplaining, you can try saying “You’re mansplaining me” and then explaining what happened in a diplomatic and pleasant way.

                "body": "Psychological Operations (PSYOP) conducted on a mass scale involve coordinated efforts to influence the attitudes, emotions, and behavior of large populations. These operations are usually executed by governments, military organizations, or other influential entities. Here is an overview of how PSYOPs are conducted on a mass scale:\n\n### 1. **Strategic Planning**\n   - **Objective Setting**: Define clear, achievable objectives for the PSYOP campaign. This could range from changing public opinion on a specific issue to destabilizing an adversary’s morale.\n   - **Target Audience Analysis**: Identify the demographic, psychographic, cultural, and sociopolitical characteristics of the target audience.\n   - **Message Development**: Craft persuasive messages that resonate with the target audience’s values, beliefs, and emotions.\n\n### 2. **Media Selection and Message Dissemination**\n   - **Traditional Media**: Utilize television, radio, newspapers, and magazines to reach a broad audience. These media can carry news stories, advertisements, or entertainment content designed to influence perceptions.\n   - **Digital Media**: Exploit social media platforms, websites, blogs, and email campaigns. Digital media allows for targeted and interactive engagement, as well as rapid dissemination of content.\n   - **Cultural Products**: Employ films, music, literature, and art to subtly incorporate desired messages into popular culture.\n   - **Influencers and Opinion Leaders**: Leverage the credibility and reach of celebrities, community leaders, and social media influencers to propagate the desired narratives.\n\n### 3. **Execution Tactics**\n   - **Propaganda**: Spread information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.\n   - **Disinformation**: Deliberately disseminate false information to mislead the target audience, causing confusion and doubt.\n   - **Psychological Warfare**: Use intimidation, fear, and uncertainty to break down the morale and cohesion of the target audience.\n   - **Cyber Operations**: Conduct cyber activities such as hacking and releasing sensitive information to create chaos and distrust among the populace.\n\n### 4. **Monitoring and Feedback**\n   - **Impact Assessment**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the PSYOP campaign through surveys, social media analytics, media monitoring, and intelligence reports.\n   - **Adaptive Strategies**: Modify messages and tactics in response to feedback and changing circumstances to maintain or enhance effectiveness.\n\n### 5. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**\n   - **Compliance with Laws**: Ensure that the PSYOP campaign complies with international laws, local laws, and ethical standards.\n   - **Minimize Harm**: Aim to achieve objectives with minimal collateral damage and avoid actions that could lead to long-term negative consequences.\n\n### Examples of Mass Scale PSYOP:\n   - **World War II Propaganda**: Both Allied and Axis powers used extensive propaganda campaigns to influence public opinion and enemy morale.\n   - **Cold War Campaigns**: The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in numerous PSYOP efforts to win hearts and minds across the globe.\n   - **Modern Disinformation Campaigns**: Various state and non-state actors use social media and other digital platforms to spread disinformation and influence political outcomes in other countries.\n\nConducting PSYOP on a mass scale requires meticulous planning, sophisticated understanding of human psychology, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing information environments.",

It also explains why he didn't use a scope or go for a body shot which would have been a guaranteed kill.\n\nIt explains why Trump 3 times delayed exiting the stage, for his hat, his shoe and the ridiculous pose, he knew there was only 1 shooter (who wasn't going to shoot him anyway) and he was safe (we know he's a notorious coward). If this was real, there is no way they could know if it was one or more shooters. It also explains his reaction of not looking behind him if he was looking right and got a pain on his right side, the natural thing is to turn around behind him but he knew where the shot was coming from which is why he continued looking over his right shoulder.\n\nThe shooter was shot as this ties up a loose end. I am on the fence with this but if the head or deputy of Trumps SS dies in the next few years, this will be something I will believe, especially if no one can see any difference in Trumps ear when the bandage comes off.\n\nOf course I will admit it is bollocks if I see reverse angle videos of blood coming from the ear either before he puts his hand up or a couple of seconds after.\n\nWhat actually happened if it was legit doesn't make sense to me on many levels. Neither does someone going out golfing with lots of trees and cover 24h after the event. Most people would want to stay inside if they thought they were a target.",

It's literally never happened in the modern era, the last time would be Reagan, and cameras weren't good enough to pick up a bullet.\n\nI guarantee if you shot a bullet in those exact conditions with that many cameras pointed at that exact spot one camera at least would catch the bullet almost every single time.

Identical to trumps.  Hers was within the statute if limitations and she got like a 9500 fine. No trial, no threat of prison.\n\nMassey from KY actually discusses during an interview how it's common practice for congress members to pay their spouse hush money from campaign funds and label it as legal expenses because who has more dirt on you than your spouse?

It also would not be hard to have a squib on the ear. What speaks against it is the actual risk of the shooter hitting by accident, that could be negated by using blanks, but there was a victim in the crowd. Now I don't subscribe to the \"fake mass shootings\" theories myself, but if it's so easy to stage mass murders as some people claim, I guess staging the murder of one person would be equally feasible.",

No trial, no threat of prison.\n\nMassey from KY actually discusses during an interview how it's common practice for congress members to pay their spouse hush money from campaign funds and label it as legal expenses because who has more dirt on you than your spouse?

It's literally never happened in the modern era, the last time would be Reagan, and cameras weren't good enough to pick up a bullet.\n\nI guarantee if you shot a bullet in those exact conditions with that many cameras pointed at that exact spot one camera at least would catch the bullet almost every single time.

That's the disconnect, there's no actual crime that interferes with the election to charge him for to begin with.\n\nThere's already a precedent set with Clinton paying for the bogus Steele dossier from her campaign funds and entering it in the books as legal fees. Identical to trumps.  Hers was within the statute if limitations and she got like a 9500 fine. No trial, no threat of prison.\n\nMassey from KY actually discusses during an interview how it's common practice for congress members to pay their spouse hush money from campaign funds and label it as legal expenses because who has more dirt on you than your spouse? Interesting enough his wife ends up dead a short time after making that statement. \n\nI really think that all of it will be tossed.",

It's literally never happened in the modern era, the last time would be Reagan, and cameras weren't good enough to pick up a bullet.\n\nI guarantee if you shot a bullet in those exact conditions with that many cameras pointed at that exact spot one camera at least would catch the bullet almost every single time.

It's also highly unlikely that comments that appeared to be aimed at sidestepping the gag order by Republican officials who attended the trial as Trump's guests will figure into Merchan's reasoning, Kuby added.\n\n>\"If the judge is smart, he'd stay away from that,\" Kuby said. \"The best way for judges not to get reversed in a sentencing is to stick to the facts and circumstances of the crimes and conviction.\"",
