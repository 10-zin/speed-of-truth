      "title": "WAR DAY TWO - Translations of a Ukrainian Journalist on the ground in Kyiv",
      "selftext_preview": "*My mom is a known Ukrainian journalist/activist who took a significant part in the 2014 revolution on Maidan, and who also produced the Oscar Nominated movie \"Winter on Fire\". As an English speaker, I decided to translate her articles for the international public.*\n\n                .\n\nAs long as were not being carpet bombed - and theres a reason for that - I will send [\\#informal\\_reports\\_from]( Kiev \n\nLast evening, our people neutralized Gostomel. At 4:20AM the rocket attacks on Kiev began. Our Air defense worked - the winged ones were neutralized.\n\nIn the morning, for example, they just casually drove armored veichals around Obolon[ . They couldnt get through Gomel, so the orcs bypassed Chernigov and went east.\n\nThey captured Konotop (250 km north-west of Kiev), and continued to put pressure on us. Kiev was bombarded. The orcs number 1 priority is to get to the government quarter, but they can go fuck themselves.\n\nIn the south, the battles for Melitopol and again New Kakhovka (a hydroelectric power station and a reservoir for the Crimea are vital for Khuilostan). Kharkiv and Donetsk-Lugansk regions were blocked by our people.\n\nAbout 20,000 assault rifles were distributed in Kiev. How to make Molotov cocktails is something everyone remembers since the Maidan Revolution. Everyone made sure to build up defense structures around the city. All men who took their families out of the city, returned.\n\nChildren and families in high-rise districts were evacuated. It would be an issue for people to escape from the 20th floor. My man already took his family and left them in Korostyshev (100 km from Kiev), returned in the morning, and went to the Teroborona fighting point.\n\n# Now, how can YOU help:\n\n**INFO SUPPORT**  Translate REAL testimonies into all possible languages: English [ German, Italian, French, etc. We might not be able attack from above, but we can do it from below as we did here: [\n\nAdditional, Ukraine has not given up a damn thing, were really fucking up these orcs, and will continue to do so to the max!\n\nSecond of all,  [\\#Give\\_STINGERS\\_Ukraine]( We need MILITARY support.

Write to friends, acquaintances, EVERYONE! They NEED to wake up!\n\nZinc coffins with your boys in it is not worth his glory, this is not imperialism, this is fucking stupidity!\n\n# Pt. 2\n\nHeavy battles for Kharkiv, Sumy in the north and throughout the south.We recaptured Konotop. Chernihiv with us. In Nikolaev, a helicopter was taken care of. They lost Kherson and Gostomel (but they gouged the strip, and blew up the bridge to Kyiv).\n\nTheyre attacking the airfields (where you can transfer troops).And infrastructure facilities (CHP in Kyiv) like they did in Mirgorod for example .Sirens were sounded through Kyiv, Kharkov, Odessa, Cherkassy.\n\nThe whole \"we bomb only the military commissar\" - is bullshit. The Orcs were spraying at the city of Okhtyrka (Sumy region) - residential buildings, bomb shelters, a kindergarten. There are seriously injured children. In Vorzel they dropped \"grads\" on an orphanage. In Melitopol and Kharkiv, hospitals (oncology and children's departments) were shot, in Kharkiv, shelling with cluster bombs banned by the EU - it was recorded [\n\n**NUMBERS**: The orcs lost up to 80 tanks \\\\Combat vehicles - 516 \\\\ Helicopters - 7 \\\\ Aircraft 10 - The Ghost of Kiev, who became a legend in 2 days, shot down 6 aircraft on the MiG-29 (2xSu-35, 1xSu-27,1xMG- 29, 2xSu-25\") [ \\\\ In manpower, Russia lost over 1200 people (killed) and about 1800 (wounded) in TWO DAYS.\n\n**MILITARY SUPPORT** Estonia is sending more javelins.\\\\ Swedish grenade launchers are handing out to our defense. \\\\The convoy from Poland has already arrived.\\\\ Stolenberg finally promised the deployment of NATO troops, air defense and heavy weapons. \\\\ Our focus is on the no-fly zone over the country, like they did in Libya in 2011.

The EU summit approved tougher sanctions. Bulgaria closed the airspace for Russia. Rallies of support were noted in almost all the capitals of Europe. But its important that you protest in front of the government and not at the Russian embassy. Swifts were finally turned off to the Rashists.\n\n**Kyiv** is preparing for night battles. The defense brigade has been formed. They coaught saboteurs, destroyed marks for landing, beacons for artillery, and prepared a blockade on the streets so their motorized brigades couldn't break through. In addition to machine guns, we got a Swedish NLAW Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapon. Kyiv is really turning into Maidan barricades, molotov cocktails, cracked paving stones, only this time firearms have been added to it all.

      "title": "How Ukrainian fighters in a small town repelled Russian forces by day and night.",
      "selftext_preview": "[\n\nThe accounts of resistance in the small garrison town of Vasylkiv have already taken on the sheen of legend. There are reports of Russian transport planes shot down, paratroopers hunted in the woods and even an unknown Ukrainian pilot nicknamed the Ghost of Kyiv defending the skies.\n\nHyperboles aside, the people of this quiet provincial town of tree-lined streets and low-rise buildings dating to the Russian empire managed to fight off Russian troops in the critical opening days of the war, preventing Russian forces from capturing strategic bases that could have allowed the nations capital, Kyiv, to be encircled.\n\nVasylkiv, home to an aviation school that has trained generations of pilots, a counterterrorism task force and an air defense command center that protects the capital and central Ukraine, became one of the first targets of a Russian attack in the first hours and days of the war. Cruise missiles slammed into the air base, and then Russian airborne forces attacked in a series of ground assaults.\n\nThey did not prevail. Accounts from residents, government officials, armed forces personnel and civilians who have enlisted territorial defense units described how Ukraine rebuffed the Russian assault and helped prevent Russias wider aims to seize control of the country.\n\nAn air base was among the first targets hit at 5 a.m. on the morning of Feb. 24, in the opening salvos of the war. The strikes damaged buildings, equipment and air defense systems.\n\nRussian airborne troops were dropped into nearby villages and began an assault, local officials and officers said. The Russian soldiers attacked during an air raid, using it to their advantage as Ukrainian troops took cover in bomb shelters.\n\nAfter the airstrikes, they tried to test the perimeter, said one air force officer involved in fighting, speaking on condition that he only be identified by his rank  a major  and his military code name, KR@M. They tried to sneak inside and they managed.\n\nFor security reasons, the officer did not specify exactly where the battles took place, except to say the Kyiv region.\n\nBy the fourth night of the war, the Russian attackers had regrouped and were better organized, said the air force officer, KR@M, a member of the quick reaction unit that was involved in the battle.\n\nHe said the Russians were equipped with assault rifles, silencers and night vision goggles, enabling to them to attack in the dark.\n\nAt 4 a.m., when the fighting started our guard was shot silently, in the head, in full darkness, he said.\n\nA fierce firefight broke out as the Russians entered the compound, he said. The Ukrainians swiftly lost six men killed, with two wounded. But with accurate fire and hurling grenades, he said they managed to kill five of the attackers and wound a sixth, forcing the remaining Russians to retreat.\n\nWe are lucky they did not know how to throw grenades properly, KR@M said of the Russians. If they had managed to throw grenades, it would be very sad, suggesting the Ukrainians could have been overrun.\n\nThe Russians seemed to have had back up, because there were signs they dragged their dead and wounded with them. We saw the blood stains but found no bodies, KR@M said. They even retrieved their shell casings, he said.\n\nHe said he was the only Ukrainians with a thermal imaging night vision and was able to shoot three of the attackers. He mourned his lost comrades, who he said did not have the same advantage. The hardest thing, as always, is to lose your friends, he said.\n\nAfter that battle on Feb. 26, the Ukrainians spotted scouts conducting reconnaissance around the perimeter of their bases, but the Russians did not mount any further attacks. Then, about a week ago, they disappeared altogether.",

      "title": "That pilot you worked with, wasnt his name Juice?",
      "selftext_preview": "Hi, I'm Katerina. I wanted to share this tribute I wrote to Andrii (Juice), a hero of Ukraine... someone who knew how flawed it was and gave his life for it anyway. \n\nAugust 25, 2023\n\nThis is a story I wanted to tell to the entire world, but couldnt put into words until now. \n\nIn the first weeks of the war, when my nonprofit's operations ground to a halt, I volunteered with the Ukrainian Air Force, helping with media communications. The pilots and their commanders had a crucial message to share  Ukraine's capacity to fight back against the russian invaders depended on the ability to fend them off in the air. Air cover was essential to protect our civilians and troops, and without Western aid, Ukraine had no hope. \n\nAs our volunteer team worked to field media requests and put out statements, we struggled with the fact that neither the commander of the Air Force nor their official spokesperson could speak English well. It felt ironic  for almost two years, my nonprofit had been working to make English fluency the norm in Ukraine and facing near-universal indifference from those with the power to help. They felt there were bigger problems and English wasnt important  until it was. \n\nThe other volunteers and I asked for English-speaking pilots to interview. The answer was bleak: *We don't have many English-speaking pilots, and most of them are already dead.* \n\nThen, one day, the message popped up in our encrypted chat thread: *We've found you someone; he's perfect.* His name was Andrii and he went by the call sign Juice. He had trained in California as part of a partnership between the Ukrainian Air Force and the US National Guard. He was smart, passionate, and empathetic. He was a force of nature. \n\nWe generally communicated in group calls and chats, where it was all business. One day, Andrii called me directly to walk me through some fighter jet terminology. He taught me about the differences between MiG29s and F-16s, between fire-and-forget missiles with radar systems and semi-active missiles. He made it all sound very clear and simple. \n\nWe went off script a bit and he told me about playing a military computer game as a teenager. In the game, russia invaded Georgia and then took Crimea, and he thought, This will actually happen, and with his moms help tried to sound the alarm. Of course, no one took him seriously. \n\nAndrii studied to become a fighter pilot. He rose through the ranks. He kept trying to urge the military into action to fight corruption and inefficiencies left over from Soviet times, to prepare for the all-out war that he felt sure would come. At one time, he opted out, resigning in protest. But when russia invaded, he immediately returned to fight. \n\n You may have heard of Andrii by another name: the Ghost of Kyiv.  He was the man behind the myth. His greatest impact was not in the skies (though he achieved so much there), but on the informational battlefield. The interviews and TV spots our team arranged, and Andriis later visit to Washington DC, played an important role in helping Ukraine secure essential air defense. Starting in March 2022, we pleaded together for NASAMs, Patriots, fighter jets. We were told it was impossible. But we told our story again and again, and made the impossible possible. \n\nAs time went on, the air force media team found more experienced and professional support. My nonprofit reopened, and I shifted off the volunteer project. Id still read Andriis messages in the group chat  incisive, funny, frustrated, irreverent. I smiled when he popped up in the news.\n\nI thought of Andrii every time one of our impossible requests was granted  alas, always too slowly, always too many months after it was needed, but still, every time a small victory. NASAMs, Patriots, fighter jets. \n\nOn the morning of August 26, 2023, I was getting ready for the day. My husband was checking his phone next to me. He gasped. \n\nI said, Tell me. \n\nHe said, That pilot you worked with, wasnt his name Juice? \n\nI think you understand the rest. \n\nAndrii died a stupid and needless death while waiting for his opportunity to fly an F-16. He was slated to be one of the first pilots to start training on the planes. \n\nI know my story of loss is almost banal in an ocean of such stories. But this story is about more than loss. Because the most incredible thing about Andrii is that he clearly saw the imperfections and challenges in the Ukrainian military before the full-scale invasion. He knew that it was flawed and he gave his life for it anyway. \n\nI sometimes wonder if Andrii would still be alive if the air force command was more responsive to his reform efforts or if a professional, English-speaking communications department existed before the war. And if that wouldnt have made the difference, what would have? \n\nBut its easy to get lost in counterfactuals. Andrii did not. He was faced with an imperfect situation, and he made the brave choices, though he knew he would likely die. \n\nDoing good is often imperfect. No matter where we live or what problems we are passionate about solving, we are faced with systemic injustice, broken political structures, corporate bureaucracies, infighting, and incompetence. \n\nFor me personally, my battlefield is the nonprofit sector. Before I started a nonprofit, I imagined this sector to be a warm and fuzzy place of do-gooders united by a desire to help others, But, much like Ukraine's Air Force, the nonprofit world can be bureaucratic, nonsensical and extremely challenging to navigate. It can be so tempting to just throw up our hands and say, *Fine! Forget it! We'll just stop*   \n*trying.* \n\nBut Andrii saw the flaws and did it anyway, because he knew it had to be done. And every day, his memory inspires me to do the same. (Full article published in Hromada newspaper, page 8:[",

      "title": "News summary from 2/25",
      "selftext_preview": "From Heather Cox Richardson, a U.S. historian who writes a daily events analysis:\n\nFighting in Ukraine is approaching Kyiv, where the government has armed its civilians to defend the city. Washington Post military reporter Dan Lamothe tweeted information from a senior defense official, who said that Russia is getting more resistance than it expected and that it has not managed to establish air superiority over Ukraine. The U.S. believes that Russia has launched more than 200 missiles at Ukraine, aimed at military sites but hitting civilian areas as well. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said today that 150,000 Ukrainians have been displaced since Russia invaded.\n\nPutin today called for Ukrainians to overthrow their own government and negotiate peace with him.\n\nPutin needed a quick victory in Ukraine, and the heroic resistance of the Ukrainians has made that impossible, buying time for pressure against him to build. Last night, 1800 Russians were arrested for protesting the war at rallies around the country; prominent Russians, including the children of leading businessmen and lawmakers, are speaking up against the invasion.\n\nWhen Facebook fact-checked Russian state media accounts and put warning labels on them, the Kremlin limited Russians access to the site, where they were sharing their anger at Putins war. Apparently, ill-trained Russian conscripts are shocked to be on the front lines in UkraineRussian law says only volunteer troops are supposed to be used there.\n\nTonight Meta, the parent company of Facebook, banned Russian state media from running ads or raising money on Meta platforms anywhere in the world. While the ban apparently does not eliminate third-party ads, it does show which way the wind is blowing.\n\nToday, members of the European Union and Britain froze the European assets of Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The U.S. also sanctioned Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, as well as Russias sovereign wealth fund, which is intended to attract capital into the Russian economy in high-growth sectors, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki. The Russian Ministry of Defense was hacked and taken down, and the personal information of its employees was leaked; the hacker group Anonymous claimed credit.\n\nFor the first time in its history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) activated its rapid response troops that can deploy quickly in case Russian troops cross the borders of NATO countries.\n\nPutin is rapidly becoming isolated. Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning the invasion and calling for an immediate end to hostilities and the withdrawal of Russias troops from Ukraine, but it was notable that China, India, and the United Arab Emirates abstained rather than vote. Also today, President Milos Zeman of Czechia and Hungarys Prime Minister Viktor Orbn, both of whom have been supporters of Putin, came out strongly against the invasion. So did Romania and Bulgaria. Kazakhstan has refused to send troops to Russia.\n\nThe Ukraine resistance has given rise to the Ghost of Kyiv, a fighter pilot who may or may not be real, and who may or may not be a woman, and who has shot down six Russian planes.

Now there is war, and it seems a little less silly to show any form of support one can to the people of Ukraine.\n\nYou are fighting valiantly, it seems. Your early successes are a (welcome) surprise to many. I do not think anyone ever doubted your courage, but in the collective conscience of the Western World Russia under Putin seems to have developed a reputation as an unstoppable juggernaut that dares no trifling. Yet here you still stand, and your people have the will to keep standing, to keep fighting, and eventually to win.\n\nPeople throw around historical allusions alot. They say it is 1939, and you are Poland. I don't think this is true. I think if any allusion to WW2 can be made, then we must look forward, to 1940-41. You are Britiain, and right now you are besieged, but you will not falter, and despite setbacks you can look to your military, and your people, with growing confidence.\n\nTo finish the metaphor, I must paraphrase a quote from Le Morte d'Arthur by way of Winston Churchill. \"Every Day brings forth its noble chance. Every chance brings forth its noble knight.\"\n\nYou already have two such examples that I am aware of so far. The Ghost of Kyiv, the first air ace of the 21st century, and the 13 men who died on Serpent Island. There were undoubtedly many more untold heroes in the first 24 hours of this tragedy, and there undoubtedly will be many more in the days ahead.\n\nThe eyes of the world are upon Ukraine. I am sorry that greater support is not more forthcoming. I am sorry that the leaders of the Western World are being intimidated by Putin.\n\nBut, I tell you this. The longer this war goes on, the greater the chance that someone else enters the fray. The world can only watch apartments get blown up, father's kissing their families goodbye, families sleeping in a metro, or young teenagers dying, so much. Popular pressure will force someone's hand. Western leaders will learn to fear their people more than Putin.\n\nUntil then I will pray for Ukraine, I will pray for peace. God bless you and keep you all.",

Tldr at bottom.\n\n- Russian and Belarusian athletes are being banned from representing their country in any and all international competitions, while the Winter Olympics was just held in concentration-camp running China. \n\n\n- Russian athletes and pro-gamers are being dropped by organizations purely based on their nationality, despite being neutral or even speaking out against the invasion.\n\n\n- WEF, Klaus Schwab, George Soros, etc are all on the side of Ukraine, and suddenly now care about a country's sovereign borders. They didnt give a shit when there was an invasion of millions illegal economic migrants that are still causing trouble over a decade later.\n\n\n- Large protest gatherings and influencers/activists/celebrities praising the protests just a week after being silent/condemning the protests in Canada and around the world, labelling them as \"super spreader events\".\n\n\n- There's propaganda from both sides but the only side that seems to be gaining viral status and global recognition is the Ukrainian propaganda. The \"Russian\" tank driving over a car? Turns out it was Ukrainian. The \"ghost of kiev\"? Bullshit. The snake island 13 martyrs? Really ~81 and they all surrendered and are alive. The shooting down of Russian jets over Kyiv? Video game footage. The tactical strike that took out some top level Russian General? He never existed. I cant think of any Russian state propaganda that has spread as quickly and freely as any of these. Also, no fact checks have been done by any of the platforms that foamed at the mouth to fact check anything during the Pandemic, even if it turned out to be true. \n\n\n- Putin is **not** hiding in the Urals. He doesnt need to. Even if he was scared of an assassination or a coup (hes not, nobody stays in power as long as he has without a tight vice on the balls of everyone around him), he is many things but hes not a coward who runs to hide in the backwaters of his country. There are plenty of safe rooms and bunkers in/near Moscow where he can still reign easily.\n\n\n- EU countries planning to remove Russia from SWIFT and block offshore accounts, even though they are still incredibly dependent on Russia for energy. Are they gonna be paying Russia in crypto? That's going to do wonders for their currencies.\n\n\n- There are glaring similarities between what is happening now and what has happened in the past with the West trying to overthrow regimes that dont play ball. Gaddafi, Saddam, Assad. We were all told things that justified war which turned out to either be extremely embellished or outright bullshit.\n\n\n- The Ukrainian government is being labelled as these heroic victims who were thrust into such an unsuspecting situation, when anyone with an eye for geopolitics and half a brain would have seen this coming a mile off. \n\n\n- Ukraine is a highly corrupt country, and human trafficking hub thanks to its size, its location on the black sea, and its connection into Europe. There is a lot of shady things going on there, more than meets the eye.\n\n\nI want to be clear, I'm not blaming the Ukrainian people, I've lived in Ukraine and they're some of the kindest people I've met. I'm also not defending Putin and his decision to invade, war is fucked. But what were seeing on Twitter or reddit or the MSM is ***not*** what is truly happening over there.\n\n\nTL:DR: Please, please, dont take things at face value. After 2 years of gaslighting, projection, and lies from the media how can anyone suddenly think we're being told the truth now? Take a step back and see the hypocrisy of how the world panders to China but condemns Russia. How they congratulate BlackFace Castreau in one breath, and then condemn Russia for arresting protestors of their own. Think, please.",

They didnt give a shit when there was an invasion of millions illegal economic migrants that are still causing trouble over a decade later.\n\n**You are comparing illegal migrants with bombs dropping on European soil. You need to remember that the last time bombs dropped at this magnitude (I know, smaller conflicts existed) was WW2. Everyone is on edge.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Large protest gatherings and influencers/activists/celebrities praising the protests just a week after being silent/condemning the protests in Canada and around the world, labelling them as \"super spreader events\".\n\n**Hypocrisy at its finest. Aren't we used to that after 2 years of Covid? They will agree with anything that's on their side, disagree with the rest even if the actions are the same.**\n\n>There's propaganda from both sides but the only side that seems to be gaining viral status and global recognition is the Ukrainian propaganda. The \"Russian\" tank driving over a car? Turns out it was Ukrainian. The \"ghost of kiev\"? Bullshit. The snake island 13 martyrs? Really \\~81 and they all surrendered and are alive. The shooting down of Russian jets over Kyiv? Video game footage. The tactical strike that took out some top level Russian General? He never existed. I cant think of any Russian state propaganda that has spread as quickly and freely as any of these. Also, no fact checks have been done by any of the platforms that foamed at the mouth to fact check anything during the Pandemic, even if it turned out to be true.\n\n**Do a bit of research on war propaganda. This is one of the few things that its actually normal in this situation.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Putin is not hiding in the Urals. He doesnt need to. Even if he was scared of an assassination or a coup (hes not, nobody stays in power as long as he has without a tight vice on the balls of everyone around him), he is many things but hes not a coward who runs to hide in the backwaters of his country. There are plenty of safe rooms and bunkers in/near Moscow where he can still reign easily.\n\n**Read above answer, same thing.**\n\n>EU countries planning to remove Russia from SWIFT and block offshore accounts, even though they are still incredibly dependent on Russia for energy. Are they gonna be paying Russia in crypto? That's going to do wonders for their currencies.\n\n**You should look more into our energy dependency to Russia. Yes, its there but not to the extent that some put it out to be. If you do a deep dive, the worst part affected by zero energy imports from Russia will be Germany's manufacturing.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There are glaring similarities between what is happening now and what has happened in the past with the West trying to overthrow regimes that dont play ball. Gaddafi, Saddam, Assad. We were all told things that justified war which turned out to either be extremely embellished or outright bullshit.\n\n**Big difference. The invading force here is Russia. That its not debatable. Don't trust the news, just look for yourself at the hundreds of videos (Yes, some are fake, but not all). Russian tanks are in Ukraine, killing people.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The Ukrainian government is being labelled as these heroic victims who were thrust into such an unsuspecting situation, when anyone with an eye for geopolitics and half a brain would have seen this coming a mile off.\n\n**Again, war propaganda.

      "selftext_preview": "I've tried posting this before, and I will post it again now. The conspiracy is the supression of the true story about Russia's claims for their incursion into Ukraine. This battle has been waged for much longer than two months. The sources will not pass the reddit filter, so they are not included in the post, however if you go to my profile, you can click on the link to the website for the list of sources in their entirety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Another Day, Another Set of Lies**\n\n****\n\nIts now April 2022, a full two years after the COVID hysteria started. Some folks are content to keep living as if there is a severe threat to public health. Weve gone through the unreliability of the PCR tests in previous posts\\[1\\], so we wont rehash that now. But the important thing to remember is that according to US Government data 375,000+\\[2\\] people died in 2020 and 400,000+ died in 2021\\[3\\]. Given that COVID gene therapy and vaccines started being administered to US citizens in December 2020, after less than six months of testing vs the standard 10 years of clinical trials, why did more people die in 2021 after the vaccine roll out?\\[4\\].\n\n\n\nIf youre lucky enough to have avoided being threatened by your employer to get the shot, good for you. Not everyone was that lucky though. The vaccine injuries pile up almost as quickly as the ads for booster shots. The return to normal is the carrot and the stick is no jab, no job or being told that you want to kill grandma. As this propaganda becomes less and less effective, the news organizations have concocted a new distraction: War.\n\n\n\nIn late February, Russian troops crossed into Ukraine. Immediately the news outlets in the west flooded the airwaves with the drum beat of war. Something about this felt similar to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In that time, we were told by Donald Rumsfeld that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons. How could he make this claim? Where was the evidence? The evidence was that Rumsfeld himself helped the Iraqi government obtain these weapons in the 1980s under the direction of the Reagan Administration\\[5\\]. Yet somehow these WMDs never turned up during or after the invasion\\[6\\]. What happened to them is anyones guess. Coming back to the Russian incursion in Ukraine we must now ask ourselves, Given that the news media has a history of lying to us, why should we trust them with news coming out of Ukraine? With their pro-war history, can we trust that theyre reporting the news in the most honest way to paint the most accurate picture of whats happening in Ukraine? Of course not.\n\nA few Russian claims about the war are as follows:\n\n* They are there to rid the Ukraine of Nazis\\[7\\].\n* There are US funded bio labs that are creating pathogens\\[8\\]\\[9\\].\n* The Ukraine government has spent the better part of the last decade engaging in genocide in the Donbass region against ethnic Russians\\[10\\].\n* Ukraine has not kept its part in the Minsk Accords\\[11\\].\n\n**Stepan Bandera: A Brief History\\[12\\]**\n\n****\n\nStepan Bandera was a Ukrainian politician, Nazi-collaborator and theorist of the militant wing of the far-right Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists(OUN) and leader of the Ukrainian Ultranationalists. Born in 1909, Bandera was radicalized in the post-WWI society after the Polish-Ukrainain War of 1918-1919, when Ukraine was briefly integrated into Eastern Poland. The event attributed to his radicalization was the refusal of Polish authorities to let him leave for Czechoslovakia to study. Alternatively, he enrolled at the Lviv Polytechnic where he began to organize Ukrainian nationalist organizations. He was caught and sentenced to death after orchestrating the 1934 assassination of Polands Minister of the Interior Bronislaw Pieracki. His sentence was commuted to life in prison, however he was released in 1939 following the Soviet-German invasion of Poland.\n\n\n\nBandera spent his time cultivating German military groups who were favorable to Ukrainian independence. When Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, he wrote the June 30, 1941 proclamation of Ukrainian Statehood in Lviv, while at the same time pledging to work with Nazi Germany. His refusal to rescind the independence decree led to his arrest by the Gestapo on July 5th 1941. A little over a year later he was sent to the Sachsechausen concentration camp.\n\n\n\nWith Germany rapidly losing the war in 1944, Bandera was released by the Nazis in the hope that he would be able to assist in the war effort. He reestablished the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council, an underground organization. He settled in West Germany where he remained the leader of the OUN-B. Fourteen years after the end of WWII, Bandera was assassinated in 1959 by the KGB in Munich.\n\n\n\n**Views and Attitudes Towards Jews**\n\n****\n\nStepan Bandera was an antisemite and Nazi collaborator, despite his imprisonment by the Nazis. Although Ukrainian nationalism did not historically include antisemitism as a core aspect of its beliefs, it saw Russians and Poles as the chief enemies with the Jews as a close contender. The hostility towards the Soviet Government as well as the Jewish minority was highlighted at the OUN-Bs conference in Krakow in May of 1941. During this conference, Banderas OUN faction adopted the program Struggle and action of OUN during the war.\\[12\\] The program declared: The Jews in the USSR constitute the most faithful support of the ruling Bolshevik regime, and the vanguard of Muscovite imperialism in Ukraine. The Muscovite-Bolshevik government exploits the anti-Jewish sentiments of the Ukrainian masses to divert their attention from the true cause of their misfortune and to channel them in a time of frustration into pogroms on Jews. The OUN combats the Jews as the prop of the Muscovite-Bolshevik regime and simultaneously it renders the masses conscious of the fact that the principal foe is Moscow.\\[13\\] In a subsection on Minority Policy, the leaders of OUN-B ordered: Moskali, Poles, and Jews that are hostile to us are to be destroyed in struggle, particularly those opposing the regime, by means of: deporting them to their own lands, eradicating their intelligentsia, which is not to be admitted to any governmental positions, and overall preventing any creation of this intelligentsia (e.g. access to education etc)... Jews are to be isolated, removed from governmental positions in order to prevent sabotage... Those who are deemed necessary may only work under strict supervision and removed from their positions for slightest misconduct... Jewish assimilation is not possible.\\[14\\]\n\n\n\nHowever when Bandera was in conflict with the Germans, the UPA under his authority sheltered Jews, including some Jewish fighters and medical personnel. By 1942, Nazi officials had concluded that Ukrainian nationalists were largely indifferent to Jews and they were willing to help or kill them depending on the effect the action taken would have towards the OUNs cause.\\[15\\]\n\n*Recent History and the Legacy of Bandera*\n\n**\n\nIn October of 2007, the city of Lviv erected a statue dedicated to Bandera. A few days later the Lviv City Council adopted a resolution establishing the Award of Stepan Bandera. On January 1, 2009, his 100th birthday was celebrated including the release of a postage stamp with his portrait. On January 1st 2014, Banderas 105th birthday was celebrated by a torchlight procession of 15,000 people in the center of Kyiv. The march was supported by the far-right Svoboda party as well as some members of the center-right Batkivshchyna.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2014 Crimean crisis and general unrest in Ukraine, some pro-Russian Ukrainians, Russians, and western voices spoke to the bad influence of Bandera on Euromaidan protestors and pro-Ukrainian Unity supporters in justifying their actions. Russian media used this to justify their actions of annexing Crimea, with Putin stating that he was saving them from the new Ukrainian leaders who are the ideological heirs of Bandera, Hitlers accomplice during WWII.\n\n\n\nOn January 22nd, 2010 on the Day of Unity of Ukraine, President Viktor Yushchenko awarded Bandera the title of Hero of Ukraine for defending national ideas and battling for an independent Ukrainian state. A grandson of Bandera accepted the award during the state ceremony on that day. The award was condemned by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Student Union of French Jews. The EU criticized the award to Bandera and expressed hope that it would be reconsidered. On May 14th 2010, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the event is so odious that it could no doubt cause negative reaction in the first place in Ukraine Already it is known a position on this issue of a number of Ukrainian politicians, who believe that solutions of this kind do not contribute to the consolidation of Ukrainian public opinion. The decision to award Bandera the title was applauded by Ukrainian nationalists in western Ukraine and by a small portion of Ukrainian Americans. The award was later voided in the courts. In December of 2018, the Ukrainian Parliament moved again to award Bandera the title but it was rejected in August of 2019.  \n \n\n*Very Recent Nazi Incidents in Ukraine*\n\nSince the Russian military has begun conducting operations in Ukraine, there has been a substantial amount of pro-Ukrainian propaganda throughout western news media and social media as well. We've been introduced to the Ghost of Kyiv; a Ukrainian fighter jet pilot who has downed numerous Russian fighter jets\\[16\\]. Soon after the media started publishing this story, it was shown to almost certainly be propaganda\\[17\\]. Some of the footage of the Ghost of Kyiv was determined to be from a video game\\[18\\]. We've also been blasted with news stories about how Russia was bombing a children's hospital\\[19\\]. It turns out that the Nazi Azov Battalion was using the hospital as a base of operations\\[20\\].\n\nThe international media seemed to even acknowledge the Nazi problems in Ukraine just a few short years ago. But Now even the Jewish ADL is defending Neo-Nazis because, They don't attack Jews or Jewish institutions\\[21\\].\n\nTo anyone considering the evidence presented so far, you'd have to ask, Why are we putting so much money into defending Ukraine from Russian invasion\\[22\\]? What is over there that is of such interest for the Unites States to defend? That question brings us to Russia's second claim.\n\n**The Biolabs in Ukraine**\n\n****\n\nOn Wednesday March 9th, Senator Marco Rubio asked Victoria Nuland, Does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons? She responded; Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact we are now quite concerned Russian troops....Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should approach... Then Senator Rubio cuts her off to say, I'm sure you're aware that the Russian propaganda groups are already putting out there all kinds of information about how they've uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in the country and with NATO's coordination. If there's a biological or chemical weapon incident or attack inside of Ukraine. Is there any doubt in your mind that 100% it would be the Russians that would be behind it? She responded by stating that, There is no doubt in my mind Senator. And it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they're planning on doing themselves.\\[23\\]\\[24\\]\n\nThe irony of calling out Russian strategy as projection is not lost on those who are paying attention. On February 3rd, US intelligence officials accused Russia of planning a false flag attack using chemical weapons\\[25\\]\\[26\\]. This type of attack involves one country either faking an attack against their own people, or even in some cases they will stage a real attack against a target, while pinning the blame on a group they wish to target. On April 6th, information was released that stated that three US intelligence officials told NBC news earlier that week that there is no evidence Russia has brought any chemical weapons near Ukraine. They also stated that the US released that information to deter Russia from using the banned munitions.\\[27\\] This type of dangerous misinformation by trusted US intelligence officials could very well lead US citizens to believe untrue information, leading to the manufacture of consent for us to send troops to defend Ukraine.\n\n*Who is Victoria Nuland?\\[28\\]*\n\n**\n\nHer career in politics started in Bill Clinton's presidency as the chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott before moving on to serve as the deputy director for former Soviet Union affairs. From 2003 to 2005 she served as the principal deputy foreign policy advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney. Immediately following this role, she served as US Ambassador to NATO in Brussels, concentrating on mobilizing European support for the US occupation of Afghanistan. In the summer of 2011 she became the special envoy for Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, then later became the State Department Spokesperson. In September of 2013 she was sworn in as the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. In this role she managed diplomatic relations with 50 countries in Europe and Eurasia, as well as with NATO, the EU, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n*Nuland and Ukraine*\n\n**\n\nShe was the lead US point person for the Revolution of Dignity\\[29\\], also known as the Maidan Revolution. This revolution took place in February of 2014 and the end of the Euromaidan protests. It ended with deadly clashed between protestors and Ukrainian Govt security forces in Kyiv, culminating with the ouster of the elected President Viktor Yanukovich and the overthrow of the Ukrainian government. Nuland established loan guarantees to Ukraine including a $1 billion loan in 2014 and the provisions of non-lethal assistance to the Ukrainian military and border guard. In 2016, she urged the new Ukrainian government to start prosecuting corrupt officials stating, It's time to start locking up people who have ripped off the Ukrainian population for too long and it is time to eradicate the cancer of corruption.\\[30\\]\n\nTo backtrack to the Maidan Revolution of 2014, on February 4th of that year a phone call from January 28th was published on YouTube in which Nuland and the US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt shared a frank conversation. During their call, they discussed the make-up of the next Ukrainian government. Nuland wanted Arseniy Yatsenyuk to be the next Prime Minister of Ukraine, while leaving Vitali Klitschko and Oleh Tyahnybok should remain out of the government. Pyatt suggested a phone call with Klitschko, as he was used to being top dog.\\[31\\]\n\nWhy is a US government official in any position to select members of a foreign government, post-revolution?\n\nNuland and Pyatt discussed how the EU would not commit to mediate, with Nuland stating Fuck the EU. This comment drew condemnation from several government leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, calling the remark unacceptable.\\[32\\] The Department of State spokesperson Jen Psaki said that the discussion was not evidence of any American plan to influence the political outcome.\n\nNuland left the State Department in January of 2017 and did not return until Joe Biden nominated her to serve as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs under Antony Blinken in January of 2021. On April 29th of 2021, her nomination was unanimously confirmed by the US Senate.\n\n*Nuland's Direct Comments on US Funded Biolabs in Ukraine*\n\n**\n\nComplete congressional testimony from Nuland about the Ukrainian bio labs can be found online via C-SPAN\\[33\\].\n\n**The Ukrainian Government and it's War with Citizens in the Donbas**\n\n****\n\nIn March of 2014, in the immediate aftermath of the Euromaidan Protest/Revolution of Dignity, protests by Pro-Russian and anti-separatist groups took place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine. These two regions are collectively called the Donbas. These demonstrations were happening around the same time that the citizens of Crimea voted to rejoin Russia and Russia then annexed Crimea. Armed Russian-backed separatist groups declared the Donetskand Luhansk People's Republics and they seized government buildings throughout the Donbas. This action led to armed conflict with the Ukrainian government forces\\[34\\].\n\nAlthough the initial protests were mostly organic and native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government, Russia took advantage of them to launch a coordinated political and military campaign against Ukraine. Ethnic Russians in the Donbas led the separatist movement from April until August of 2014. During that time, the Russian government treated this conflict as a proxy war given that the Ukraine generally regarded as a stand-in for the west, although weapons and support from the west are noticeably absent\\[35\\]. In this time, the Russian government employed a hybrid approach, using propaganda, irregular fighters, regular Russian troops, and conventional military support, all of which had the effect of destabilizing the Donbas\\[34\\].\n\nThe Ukrainian government launched a military counter-offensive against the pro-Russian forces in the Donbas in April of 2014, called the Anti-Terrorist Operation. By late August of 2014, this operation was appearing to be quite the success in pushing back the separatist forces, nearly to the Russia border. In response, Russia commenced with a conventional invasion. There were reports that the Ukrainian forces were being shelled from behind the Russian border. Between August 22nd and the 25th of 2014, Russian artillery, personnel and what Russia referred to as a humanitarian convoy crossed the Russia-Ukraine border. Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, called these late August incursions a direct invasion by Russia of Ukraine.\\[36\\] By any standard definition of the word, he would be correct, although other Western and Ukrainian officials called it a Russian stealth invasion.\\[37\\] Since then Russia's official position on the presence of their military in the Donbas has been vague. Officials have denied the presence of regular armed forces in Ukraine, however on several occasions they've confirmed the presence of military specialists. They would then argue that they were forced to deploy them to defend the Russian-speaking population\\[38\\]\\[39\\].\n\nAs a result of the Russian invasion, DPR and LPR separatists regained much of the territory they'd lost during the Ukrainian government's offensive. On September 5th 2014, Ukraine, Russia, the DPR and LPR signed a ceasefire agreement names the Minsk Protocol. Violations of the ceasefire occurred on all sides of the conflict. The ceasefire officially collapsed in January of 2015. Minsk II was signed on February 12th 2015. Immediately following the signing of the agreement, separatist forces launched an offensive on Debaltseve\\[40\\].\n\nSince the start of the conflict, there have been 29 ceasefires. None of them have lasted. The longest ceasefire was in 2016 and lasted for six weeks\\[41\\]. In October of 2019 Ukraine, Russia, the DPR, the LPR, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) all agreed to a roadmap for ending the conflict\\[42\\]. Unfortunately the conflict never stopped.\n\nRussia officially recognized the DPR and LRP on February 21st 2022 and on February 24th they officially crossed the Ukraine-Russia border with their troops.\n\n*Lessons to the United States*\n\n**\n\nAlthough one could see Russia's support of the Ethnic Russians in the Donbas region as a noble effort, that effort ultimately prolonged the conflict by giving the DPR and LRP citizens the means to continue fighting in the conflict. As much as Russia wanted to support these separatists, they bear a lion share of the responsibility for the continued death count. According to the numbers by the Ukrainian government, around 14,600 separatists in the Donbass region had been killed in the conflict\\[43\\]. In being objective we must ask, If Russia had not prolonged the conflict, how many of these separatists would still be alive?\n\nAs the US Government has given Ukraine approximately $418 million per year from the US State Department and the US Agency for International Development. Although some of this is classified as non-lethal assistance, this aid does include body armour, helmets, trucks, heavy engineering equipment and patrol boats that directly serve US and Ukrainian security goals\\[44\\]. In the first four weeks of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US Government has given Ukraine over $8.2 billion in assistance\\[45\\]. For context, from 2014 until February 2022, we had given $3.34 billion to Ukraine.\n\nIf the US wants this conflict to be prolonged, we must keep funding Ukraine. After all, we are really great at funding proxy wars that end in our humiliating defeat (Vietnam), or worse, we fight against an enemy with undefined borders (terrorists in Afghanistan) which also ends with our humiliating surrender that culminates with 20 years of senseless deaths of Americans and Afghanis. Let's not forget how we abandoned billions of dollars of military equipment into the hands of our supposed enemy. Given what we've learned so far, here are some ways our actions of funding the Ukrainian government against Russia could be seen by future historians. One, we decided to arm a country with a current history of Nazism in order to fund a proxy war with Russia. Two, our funding of the conflict prolonged the suffering of the Ukrainian people. Three, US troops were deployed into a country in which we had no obvious financial or socioeconomic interest for reasons that our leaders determined were not only appropriate, but necessary.\n\nWill we learn our lesson this time? Probably not.\n\n**Did Ukraine Violate the Minsk Accords?**\n\n****\n\nAs noted in the previous section, Ukraine did not keep its promise in the Minsk Accords, but neither did Russia, DPR or the LPR factions. Russia claims to act in the best interests of the Russian speakers in the Donbas, however, it seems they are using that as an excuse to go into Ukraine in a bid to prevent the expansion of NATO. Although the details of this agreement for NATO not to expand one inch to the East are disputed\\[46\\], we can look at the situation if the shoe was on the other foot.\n\n*A Thought Experiment*\n\n**\n\nImagine that Russia was expanding its sphere of influence up from South America. First they started with Brazil and slowly allied with countries north of it. They ally with Venezuela and start buying their oil. Then they ally with Panama and now have more of an influence with how the Panama Canal is operated and how much money is charged as trade tariffs. The US passively objects to the expansion of the South America-Russia Treaty Organization.\n\nFor years the Russians have been funding scientific research in Mexico and have been funding military operations there as well. Since 2014 the Russian government has given Mexico $446 billion in funding each year. Buildup of Russian arms, similar to the Cuban Missile Crisis, has been happening along the US-Mexico border. American Ex-pats living in border towns such as Calexico and Nogales have been the target of Mexican government harassment. This is due to their prejudice from their history with the US due to such things as the CIA funding drug lords Sinaloa Cartel via the program Fast and Furious\\[47\\].\n\nNow the US Intelligence Agencies discover that Mexico is housing dangerous biological pathogens on the US border, while being allied with a hostile foreign power. They are also aware that Mexico is thinking of joining the Russian-South American Treaty Organization, effectively making it so that Russia now borders the USA. How would we expect the US government to act? Would they be wrong in launching a preemptive strike?\n\nThese are all very important questions that deserve to be looked at closer.\n\n**Tying Up Loose Ends**\n\n****\n\nThe purpose of this report is not to be used as an apology for Russian actions in Ukraine. We are being bombarded by the news media with the idea that we must #SupportUkraine. No one cares about the actions of the US Government in the Middle East, the Australian Government's internment of its own people, or the crimes the Chinese Government is inflicting against its own citizens by imprisoning them in their own homes. Why are the news organizations only focusing on hyping up fervor against Russia? Are they trying to manufacture consent for war with Russia?\n\nWe live in a time now where truth is censored and replaced with the approved narrative of the world governments. The folks in charge realized that not only could they no longer scare us with the threat of COVID, a disease with a 99.98% survival rate, so they switched the narrative to one of destabilization of Ukraine under the guise of democracy being under attack.\n\nUkraine is not a shining example of democracy, unless you consider the corruption that modern democracies share\\[48\\]\\[49\\]\\[50\\]. Let's take a look at the current makeup of Zenensky's cabinet.\n\n****\n\n**Anatomy of a Democracy: A Bad Joke**\n\n****\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy created and produced a TV series that ran from 2015-2019 called Servant of the People. In this TV series he plays a high school teacher who is unexpectedly elected President of the Ukraine after a viral video filmed by one of his students shows him making a profane rant against the corruption in his country. On March 31st 2018, a political party with the same name was registered with the Ministry of Justice and Zelenskyy was elected President of the Ukraine on April 21st 2019. Not too bad for someone who is known for playing the piano with his genitals for five minutes\\[51\\] as well as discussing the Nazi problem in Ukraine by noting how they had trouble keeping copies of Mein Kampf in stock\\[52\\].\n\nAndriy Borisovich Yermak is a Ukrainian film producer, lawyer and current Head of the Presidential Administration. Zelenskyy appointed him on February 11th, 2020. Yermak founded the Gernet International Media Group in 2012. He became acquainted with Zelenskyy in 2011 when Zelenskyy was the general producer on the TV channel Inter. After working with Zelenskyy on his presidential campaign, he was appointed as the Chief of Staff.\n\nZelenskyy's inner circle of his cabinet also include the following people. Andre Bodin is a lawyer with the entertainment industry and he serves as the head of the Presidential Administration. Sergey Sheffey is a comedy writer who is also serving as the president's chief policy advisor. Ivan Bakanov is the head of a comedy film company and is serving Zelenskyy as the deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Intelligence Service. Lastly, Sergei Sivoko, comedian and Zelenskyy's partner in acting, is serving as a Senior Advisor to the Ukrainian National Defense Committee\\[53\\].\n\nIt's not just one comedian who is running the government in Ukraine, it's his whole entourage. If you elect a monkey, don't be surprised when you get a circus.\n\n",

It all kind of started as I studied, and minored, in the Russian language in one of our military academies, and thus I found myself on a lot of NATO training deployments.\n\nI'll address some of your points, but in short, the entire Western world and our military apparati is actually in shock that Russia was unable to take Ukraine in it's initial invasion. They're far weaker than any of us actually anticipated. And the cost of helping Ukraine defend itself is microscopically minimal, as most aid is in the form of arms that have already been paid for and sitting on the shelf.\n\nTo your points:\n\n> Ukraine is losing the war\n\nA more accurate statement is Ukraine is *not winning* the war, which is far different than stating Ukraine is *losing.* That's because, well, Russia is also not *winning* the war.\n\nIt's far more accurate to call the war a stalemate right now.\n\nIt may very well turn into Ukraine's favor in the next year if they are able to use Western arms and armor and training to exploit Russian weaknesses across the front in counteroffensives.\n\n> Ever since the beginning, the narrative was always \" Stop Russia before they attack the west\", but did anyone honestly believe Russia was going to plan on attacking more western countries?\n\nThat's sort of the propaganda narrative, but in defense circles... not really.\n\nFirst, the chance of Russian invasion into NATO countries was always considered low, but not negligible. The argument over whether Russia would really want to unite the former Soviet-bloc states was based on how credible they believed the NATO deterrence was, and if countries such as the US would have the appetite to go to war for countries like Estonia.\n\nHowever, the far more important philosophical question at hand is whether it should be accepted that nuclear-armed countries should be able to forcefully annex other countries without pushback. The Western answer to this is *unequivocally no.* Which is why *zero nations on earth other than Syria and North Korea recognize the annexations.*\n\nAs many Western intelligence analysts predicted from the start, Russia's war was never about the independence of the Donbass. It was about annexing them from the absolute start. This not only gives Russia a land bridge to Crimea (which was also illegally annexed), but also denied Ukraine the ability to use gas and oil fields to provide Europe with another option than Russia for their resources.\n\n> The media has made us all believe that Russia is a weak and incompetent military force\n\nRussia was largely considered the #2 military in the world behind the US, with decades of modernization driving it to be a formidable fighting force. This has turned out to be a total farce, in my opinion mostly because of their inflexible logistics capabilities and reliance on rail, but also incredibly in their inability to establish air superiority.\n\n> A country apparently so well equipped in aid and military equipment should have pushed Russia back into their own borders by now, right?\n\nUkraine is still a relatively weaker military. They have less trained men, less equipment, and a significantly smaller economy and military industrial complex. The fact that they've survived as long as they can is a testament partly to their resilience, but in my opinion mostly to the flaccid lack of *decisive victories* by Russia.\n\n> Either it's a money laundering scheme or the narrative portrayed to us simply isn't true.\n\nThe true narrative - not the one you'll find on Reddit's worldnews or noncredibledefense threads - is that somehow a significantly weaker country like Ukraine has manage to repulse the decisive engagement of Kyiv and even successfully retaken key cities and terrain to drive Russia to a stalemate.\n\nIn closing, yes, there is propaganda. There is propaganda in literally every war. But it's not propaganda to say Ukraine is overperforming every expectation in defending their nation. The horrors of this war are real, Russia is indeed the aggressor, they got greedy and severely undermined Ukraine's resilience while incomparably overestimating their own abilities.\n\nAs for the amount of aid given to them, most is in hard, material arms that are already paid for. I can't think of a more noble way for them to be used than for Ukraine to defend itself.",

Trains are faster than heavy lift helicopters and way more sensible than any other form of air transport.\n\nTruth is the U.S. hasn't had to fight an adversary with real weapons since the 50s.

Farsi, Arabic, Russian, etc.\n\nRussian logistics, compared to the Army in my experience, way over-index on rail and under-utilize rolling stock like HEMTTs. You can drop a US army brigade in the middle of a desert with zero rail and they'll have a support battalion and a support brigade of strictly trucks that can go literally anywhere and keep an uninterrupted flow of supplies.\n\nSo, I'm not necessarily talking about mobility, but the regular old 'last-mile' of getting beans and bullets (and other sustainment services) to the lines.

They know the reality, that a war with Russia would be an insane bloodbath that our other NATO allies would abandon in a heartbeat. Our allies don't spend shit on their military and they don't send troops. A real war with Russia would be fought in France, Poland, Germany and they know it.

Had Ukraine gone better for Russia countries like Poland and the Baltics would definitely have been on the menu. \n\nRussia in peace times spends ~$75b/annually on military, its safe to assume this past year has seen that increase significantly. The Western support is humanitarian, economic and lethal also your numbers are a high and counting promised aid to be received throughout 2023.

Farsi, Arabic, Russian, etc.\n\nRussian logistics, compared to the Army in my experience, way over-index on rail and under-utilize rolling stock like HEMTTs. You can drop a US army brigade in the middle of a desert with zero rail and they'll have a support battalion and a support brigade of strictly trucks that can go literally anywhere and keep an uninterrupted flow of supplies.\n\nSo, I'm not necessarily talking about mobility, but the regular old 'last-mile' of getting beans and bullets (and other sustainment services) to the lines. They've got a serious problem with them. Remember that gigantic convoy parked on the road to Kyiv? It came to a grinding halt because of the inability to repair and replace parts, tires, distribute fuel, etc. That was a logistics problem set, plain and simple.\n\n> Truth is the U.S. hasn't had to fight an adversary with real weapons since the 50s.

Look back on my comments, I never claimed Russia would roll over to the United States in a fight. It would be an absolute bloodbath of epic proportions. I'd never wish that on my worst enemy.\n\nWhat I did say in my original comment, however, is that with hindsight there are some pretty clear reasons why Russia wasn't able to steamroll Ukraine in the first few weeks like *every country and analyst assumed they would.* And I like to point to the inability to sustain their troops and the collosally massive stalled convoy of combat vehicles outside of Kyiv. That was due largely to bottlenecks in logistics, to include things like fuel, spare tires, maintenance parts, etc, where there was no deliberate supply chain from A to Z. Everything points to Russia assuming this would be done in days, not years.\n\nRussia had the 'supposed' 2nd best military in the world... and they're in a stalemate and even lost some conquered cities almost one year ago. It surprised everyone, probably even the Ukrainians, that Russia wasn't able to decisively end the war early on. It's also very fair to say that Russia has under-performed compared to everyone's expectations, even Russia's.",

      "selftext_preview": "I didn't write it, and I don't subscribe to Catholic \"miracles\" of Fatima etc, just posting it here\n\nVery few people in the US know what is actually happening in Ukraine right now  and the Fake News is definitely not the place to find out.\n\n\nWhat is certain is that many early reports, including photos and video from the scene have turned out to be PSYOPs, such as Russian tanks running over motorists, bombings of residential buildings and the \"Ghost of Kyiv\" that have turned out to be fake. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger has shared no less than three such fake stories on Twitter.\n\n\nI've seen reports that Russian forces vaporized both the Ukrainian air force and the navy within the first hour, I've seen video of a truly massive explosion from a weapons depot that was bombed in Cherkasy and a video from an American living in Kyiv, saying that the Russians had not turned off telephony, electricity or water; that the utilities were all working in the capital city.\n\n\nThe main targets appear to be Ukrainian military bases and several biolabs run by the US Department of Defense  up to thirteen of them spread out all over Ukraine. All of these have been bombed.\n\n\nThe Hopium crowd believes Putin is liberating the world from the Deep State, by destroying their bioweapons labs and their money-laundering headquarters  and I'd love for them to be right.\n\n\nHappily, there is some serious prophecy horsepower to support this Hopium. If Russia ends up saving the world, it would be a fulfillment not only of Edgar Cayce's prophecies in 1944 but those of the famous Marian apparitions in both Ftima, Portugal in 1917 and in Medjugorje, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1981.\n\n\nThe late Father Malachi Martin claims to have read the 3rd secret of Ftima. Without disclosing its full contents, which he had sworn to keep secret, he told radio host, Art Bell in the 1990s that the prophecy essentially said Russia would commit the error of Communism, then heal itself of this scourge and proceed to lead the way for the rest of the world:\n\n\n\"Salvation for the world, the cure for the world ills, will start in the Ukraine and in Russia, and that was why the Virgin in the Fatima vision of 1917 was supposed to have spoken actively about Russia and that Russia first of all has to be cured of her errors and then she will help the entire world to get better and to cure itself of its sins.\"\n\n\nIn October of 1981, Our Lady of Medjugorje revealed her \"Russia Prophecy\" to six young children. She said \"Russia will come to glorify God the most, the West will make civilization progress but without God and will act like their own creator,\" as recorded by Marian expert, Father Ren Laurentin.\n\n\nThe Medjugorje apparitions had begun shortly after the first assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II and he said of them, \"Medjugorje is a continuation, an extension of Ftima. Our Lady is appearing in Communist countries primarily because of problems that originate in Russia.\"\n\n\nAt Ftima in 1917, the apparition had ordered the Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which Pope John Paul II took very seriously after his nearly shooting and which he completed on March 24, 1984. This was swiftly followed by the collapse of atheist communism, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union on Christmas day 1991.\n\n\nIn 1944, Edgar Cayce prophesied that Russia would help prevent the destruction of mankind. He foresaw a future world financial crisis, and he pointed to Russia as being the \"thorn in the side\" of the financial powers that were organizing themselves against the good of humanity, describing Russia's role as being the \"hope of the world\":\n\n\n\"In Russia there comes the hope of the world, not as that sometimes termed of the communistic, or Hater shit, no; but freedom, freedom! That each man will live for his fellow man! The principle has been born. It will take years for it to be crystallized, but out of Russia comes again the hope of the world.\n\n\n\"Guided by what? That friendship with the nation that hath even set on its present monetary unit 'In God We Trust.'\"\n\n\nIt would be wonderful if that's what's happening over there but if nothing else, it looks like Vladimir Putin has cured COVID. New York State will be lifting the mask mandate on schools and New York City will soon follow.",

This is the strangest invasion I've ever heard of.\n\nMounds of fake hero stories/propaganda that came and got debunked within 36 hours, e.g. Snake Island, Ghost Of Kyiv, \"Russian Tank\".. all nonsense. \n\nThe only thing I've seen evidence of is:\n\n1. Some explosions and smoke\n2. People in Ukraine freaking out\n\nI haven't seen any convincing video of battle. I've seen far more scenes of war in the past from areas without electricity/high-speed internet where no one has a 4K camera cellphone. People calling for a no fly-zone but is there any evidence of Russian airforce operating in the country?\n\nI'd guess this is just the CIA fucking around but there's video of Putin saying he's invading. I guess I could go mega tinfoil hat and suspect it's a deep-fake but I honestly have no idea. This whole situation just seems like bs. It's setting off my spidey-senses big time. Maybe I'm wrong but this invasion seems fake.\n\n**Edit**: To the pro-war shills who are claiming I'm a pro-Russian shill: How would it make any sense for me to be skeptical of the situation given Putin said himself on live TV he was going to invade? Why would a supposed pro-Russian shill (me) claim the invasion isn't real and Putin is lying? I think you need to ask your manager for new narrative material because this reply doesn't make sense.",

OTOH Russian forces have been very focused in certain areas. For example, a large Russian force has been moving South from Belarus towards Kyiv, which is not particularly far. We don't know all the details of this fight, but the Ukrainian forces cannot likely be very effective against this Russian force on an open battlefield, therefore the Ukrainians are likely allowing the Russians to advance to more closed in areas like towns and cities where they have better odds at winning. Thus, we have seen Russians move relatively quick through open countryside only to be seriously stalled on the outskirts of Kyiv, where many Ukrainian forces are currently stationed. There is really nothing odd about this.",

Incredible ability of mechanized forces to maneuver combined with effective ranges that hover around 5km for MBT direct fire, around 8-9km for ATGMs and 20km+ for artillery means the \"no-mans land\" between the forces is large, dynamic and terribly complex, with its barriers subject to change by several kilometers from simple maneuver. \n\nBut that's only the kinetic side of things. Sitting on a piece of land doesn't mean you control it. Locals become an immediate factor - the Ukrainian government is specifically leveraging them to report on Russian troop movements.\n\nOn top of this, each side is taking measures to hide and deceive their own intentions and force dispositions for hopefully obvious reasons. The only \"full picture\" of the front lines would be in Russian or Ukrainian Brigade HQs for that particular slice of the battle, and that's only after endless ongoing analysis. You don't hear about it because 1. They wouldn't reveal their own troop movements, 2. They won't reveal their enemy's movements, as that just reveals to your enemy how much you know, and 3. They're too busy to brief your sorry ass\n\nWhere are the embedded reporters? Largely non existent. This is eastern Europe. They don't give a fuck about that sort of stuff. Freedom of press is \"nice\" but not a priority. These people just prioritize things differently than you.\n\nWe do know that Russia has launched to amphibious invasions on either side of the dnieper, has launched incursions through speratist territory, and is driving towards kyiv via chernobyl. That's all you'll really know outside of conflict in major population centers. Don't expect footage of the covering force battles that occur between population centers. Theyre too dynamic, quick and lethal for people to prioritize filming.\n\n\nRemember historically... there's a ton of pictures and video of the post-d day western front in wwii, but nearly only paintings of 4 years of the most intense sustained fighting in human history ever on the eastern front. The east just don't update their insta when the gauntlet is down.",

The same problems have been endured in Donetsk and Luhansk for 8 years. These is a huge amount of physical and video evidence and testimony from residents of the region on these issues yet it has been entirely ignored by almost all mainstream Western media outlets.\n\nDespite the fact that they now place a huge focus on the conflict there, they make absolutely no effort to speak to people in the actual warzone, i.e. the EAST, not Kiev where the 'journalists' rest in 5 star hotels and hyperbolically report on occasional rocket strikes against military targets as being \"a city under siege.\"\n\nThey have no hesitancy rushing off stories on hoaxes like Snake Island and the Ghost of Kiev, or dead Generals (like Andrey Mordvichev) who later turn out to be completely alive. But they completely ignore things Ukraine firing a rocket into the completely non-militarized center of Donetsk killing more than 20 civilians, the on-camera shooting of Russian POWs, the brutal ISIS-style execution, also on camera, of another, the kidnapping of Orthodox priests by far-right militias, the murders of town mayors by the same groups, the Ukrainian secret service assassinating one of their own negotiators, and **many** more stories with far more evidence than the lurid lies they  accept at face value.\n\nThere are undoubtedly some journalists who have integrity and have tried to promote more balanced reporting, but the modern MSM is a business that chooses narratives that are politically or commercially beneficial to them and their backers. Major television networks and newspapers and other MSM are, more than ever, a well-honed Public Relations, Advertising and Propaganda industry that needs to be repeatedly condemned for the cancer that it causes.\n\nApologies for the rant but its one thing to see this kind of suffering, another to have the media ignore it, and something else to have them lie about the causes of and culpability for this violence.\n\nEdit: Patrick Lancaster has also put up [another video]( with interviews of residents (the end of which is very touching). The truth is coming out through independent (true) journalists, but the question is whether it will ever reach most peoples eyes and ears.",

      "selftext_preview": "So, I don't completely get the ghost of Kiev... But it reminds me of this piece which at the time, had sources..a ('comedy' site with cited sources at the original time I saw it)\n\nI found the original story that made me think of this. It's quoted from the  site but it had legit sources to back it up at the original time I read it. Pasting below:\n\nI found the story! I'll copy it down below:\n\nWho Was He?\n\nSimo Hayha had a fairly boring life in Finland. He served his one mandatory year in the military, and then became a farmer. But when the Soviet Union invaded his homeland in 1939, he decided he wanted to help his country.\n\nSince the majority of fighting took place in the forest, he figured the best way to stop the invasion was to grab his trusty rifle, a couple of cans of food and hide in a tree all day shooting Russians. In six feet of snow. And 20-40 degrees below zero.\n\nCan you spot Hayha?Neither could the Russians.\n\nOf course when the Russians heard that dozens of their men were going down and that it was all one dude with a rifle, they got fucking scared. He became known as \"The White Death\" because of his white camouflage outfit, and they actually mounted whole missions just to kill that one guy.\n\nThey started by sending out a task force to find Hayha and take him out. He killed them all.\n\nThen they tried getting together a team of counter-snipers (which are basically snipers that kill snipers) and sent them in to eliminate Hayha. He killed all of them, too.\n\nOver the course of 100 days, Hayha killed 542 people with his rifle. He took out another 150 or so with his SMG, sending his credited kill-count up to 705.\n\nSince everyone they had was either too dead or too scared to go anywhere near him, the Russians just carpet-bombed everywhere they thought he might be. Supposedly, they had the location right, and he actually got hit by a cloud of shrapnel that tore his coat up, but didn't actually hurt him, because he's the fucking White Death, damn it.\n\nFinally on March 6th, 1940, some lucky bastard shot Hayha in the head with an exploding bullet. When some other soldiers found him and brought him back to base, he \"had half his head missing.\" The White Death had finally been stopped...\n\n...for about a week. In spite of having come down with a nasty case of shot-in-the-face syndrome, he was still very much alive, and regained consciousness on March 13, the very day the war ended.\n\n--------------------------\n\nSounds like propoganda to me, even in the sources.

Off-the-shelf, Starlink can provide communication capabilities to a variety of end-users, such as consumers, schools, businesses and other commercial entities, hospitals, humanitarian organizations, non-governmental and governmental organizations in support of critical infrastructure and other services, including during times of crisis. However, Starlink is not designed or intended for use with or in offensive or defensive weaponry or other comparable end-uses. Custom modifications of the Starlink Kits or Services for military end-uses or military end-users may transform the items into products controlled under U.S. export control laws, specifically the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 C.F.R.  120-130) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 C.F.R.  730-774) requiring authorizations from the United States government for the export, support, or use outside the United States. Starlink aftersales support to customers is limited exclusively to standard commercial service support. At its sole discretion, Starlink may refuse to provide technical support to any modified Starlink products.\n\n\n\nThis story is old. It happened way earlier in the year, and people accusing Elon of aiding Russia are just as dishonest now as they were then. Starlink is a global-spanning communications network that can reach any middle of nowhere corner of the world. You do NOT want that technology developed as a weapons platform, or else any random nutcase suddenly has access to a DIY drone control device they can hook bombs up too.\n\nThat's why it's explicitly against their TOS to use it that way, and why they never agreed to let Ukraine use it for weapons.\n\n\"SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell confirmed in February that the company took steps to prevent Ukraine's military from using Starlink satellite Internet with drones.\n\n\"We were really pleased to be able to provide Ukraine connectivity and help them in their fight for freedom. It was never intended to be weaponized. However, Ukrainians have leveraged it in ways that were unintentional and not part of any agreement,\" Shotwell said at the time. Shotwell didn't provide details on how SpaceX disrupted Ukraine's use of Starlink but said, \"there are things that we can do to limit their ability to do that... there are things that we can do and have done.\"\n\n\n\nSpaceX abided by the rules. They are not an arms dealer. Ukraine tried to use a piece of technology in a manner that went beyond the agreements that were made; they by default tried to get Starlink to provide service for weapons systems, and service was throttled in those specific contexts because doing so is illegal and against what SpaceX and the DOD consented too. That's it. The consequences of that choice falls on those who made that choice--and it wasn't SpaceX who put their kits on drones.\n\nYou ask me and this whole story is a complete, abject failure in journalistic integrity. The very people who claim to be most against Elon Musk are, in this instance, unwittingly advocating for him to be granted more unilateral power by demanding he provide service for weapons guidance systems without the approval of the department of defense. They are so concerned with the cheap and easy \"haha rocket man bad\" that they're too stupid to realize they're basically angry he didn't get involved and followed the rules, just because this time it would've been for a side we happen to agree with.\n\nBut Starlink is geofenced from Russia, it will not work in Russian borders or in territory controlled by Russia--legitimate or not--and this means Starlink kits attached to drone devices flown over Russian territory wouldn't work even if the DOD had granted Starlink a military service contract (which it didn't; no contract existed between Starlink and the DOD until 4 months after this incident). Once again, this fact is just lost on people. People are accusing Musk of siding with Russia for disabling Starlink's ability to function in Russian controlled territory, like Crimea. That is the fucking opposite of siding with Russia; it's ensuring vital infrastructure can't fall into Russian hands and be hacked or in any way reverse engineered. Starlink has been running circles around Russian cyberwarfare since the service went online in Ukraine, so much so that they started threatening the satellites themselves\n\n\n\nThis is, again, another reason SpaceX has been so hardline in how the service is used in Ukraine. They do not want to give the Russian military any reason or excuse to start targeting Starlink itself as a military target, which would not only be a major international incident, it would also be the first major usage of space as a battle ground. And if you don't believe they'd do that, or are incapable of it, Russia destroyed an old satellite in 2021 with a missile.\n\n\n\nThey absolutely would start targeting Starlink as a military target if it was used as a weapon's guidance platform, and the USA would (rightfully) classify Starlink as a weapons system under ITAR.\n\nStarlink is a vital infrastructure to Ukraine citizens, and it's already stretching its operational parameters by providing vital communications infrastructure to its military. Without it, they'd be screwed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it can only remain in service as it is if it retains its status as a communications infrastructure, and nothing else. But again, all that matters to people is that they get their \"haha rocket man bad\" kicks, so they don't bother looking into the full story, asking questions, or how the context might mean that they're fucking advocating for corporations getting involved in major wars without oversight, and that Russian territory should have access to Starlink.",

Ukrainian air defense capabilities had been degraded by Russian attacks, but remained operational. Military aircraft from both nations continued to fly over Ukraine. \n\n\n\n* A Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet. \n\n\n\n* The Ukrainian General Staff claimed that a Ukrainian Su-27 fighter had shot down a Russian Il-76 transport plane carrying paratroopers to the city of Vasylkiv. Mayor Natalia Balasinovich said the city was then successfully defended by Ukrainian forces. \n\n\n\n* A second Russian military transport plane was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles (85 kilometers) south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n* A damaged Ukrainian Su-27 managed to make an emergency landing across the border in Romania. Two F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft of the Romanian Air Force escorted it in. The Ukrainian pilot is now in the custody of Romanian military authorities.\n\n\n\nI'm sure there will be more updates as time goes on.

Not everything is a military / government tactic.\n\nMaybe Im missing something but can you give me a couple reasons as to how this would be detrimental and considered propaganda? Im genuinely curious. It seems many share the stance of the Ghost being 100% fake, and believe that because some people might believe in it automatically means they will also believe in fake stuff that Russia says.
