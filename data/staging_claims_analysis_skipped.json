This war won't be over next week. It probably won't be over in a year from now. If the West wants Ukraine to win, they need to invest in the medium to long term. I've heard the US is short of mothballed F-16s at the moment, but they have a ton of mothballed F/A-18s and F-15s.

A lot of the techniques used in the F-22 are from the 90's, just like the soon to retire B-2. Also the F-22 has what amounts to a prototype data link that only talks to other F-22's, so they have to use a U-2 flying overhead to act as a \"translator\" to link the F-22's IFDL link with the F-35 and others using the MADL protocol. So really, even if they had the tooling and workers available, it wouldn't be worth spending the money to restart the line. Better to just plow ahead and get the NGAD replacement flying.",

The initial production goal for the F-22, which had already been reduced when the Soviet Union collapsed, seemed like overkill in that context, and so the number of planes ordered was reduced by Congress. Development of the F-35 continued, as it was a multirole fighter that was designed for a much broader array of missions, and would be theoretically cheaper to build than the F-22.\n\nBy the time the US shifted back to prioritizing Russia/China, the F-22 production lines had all been shut down due to the US ordering far fewer planes than they initially anticipated when they set up the production lines. Given the cost to reconstitute them, the genuinely impressive performance of the F-35, and the fact that their 6th generation fighter program was well underway, it didn't make sense to try to produce any more F-22s, and instead just rely on the F-35 until the NGAD is ready to replace the existing F-22 fleet.

Experience is much more valuable, knowledge of the local area can also be a benefit. History is full of stories of older geared military beating more modern geared militaries for various reasons. Experience often being a key factor. One example of the top of my head was the Belgian tankers with their old leopards 1s beating other countries with theoretically better tanks in wargames. Just because they knew their old tanks so well they pushed it to the limit and then some.\n\nRegardless if it's real or not, it's fantastic inspiration for the Ukrainians and the feeling of having a guardian angel flying over you.

      "body": "Scramble alarms go off. We see several pilots running towards the QRF hangar where a few glorious Mig-29 are being spooled up by the ground crew. We focus on one of them, climbing the lead Mig-29 painted white with greyish streaks of digi-camo. On the nose, a blue and yellow emblem is visible as well as the name of the pilot Ghost. \r  \n\r  \nA Ukrainian pilot donned a flight suit, armed with a .45 pistol under his arm in a holster so as to not interfere with the movement of his upper body. He has a helmet on, with the oxygen mask dangling from a strap. As he sits down, the MIG-29 comes to life. A couple of arms secure his straps and with a few words the pilot presses buttons and the canopy comes down as the plane starts moving forward out of the bunker. \r  \n\r  \nRoaring takeoff shot from the end of the runway and hovering outside and at an angle at the cockpit. \r  \n\r  \nWe take off and switch to a camera view of one of the air intakes to the side of the plane. We see the plane streaking to the air\r  \n\r  \nInside the cockpit, a few lights start flashing and an ominous beeping sound is made\r  \n\r  \nThe plane violently rolls left and dives, whilst popping off flares. We hear the heavy breathing of the pilot in his mask as he endures massive G-forces. \r  \n\r  \nNow the tracking radar locks on to a Russian target. The pilot screams fox-1 and again peels off, only to find another target on his targeting radar. He quickly presses a few buttons and calls fox-2.\r  \n\r  \nOne smoke plume is seen in the distance, in the foreground is a field with cows. A Russian helicopter crashes and skimps across the surface of the field. It stops in a thunderous explosion. We see one of the soldiers in the back run out, burning, finally dropping. As we pan right, we see a dot that quickly becomes bigger. In a roaring sound, caused by the afterburners the Ghost of Kyiv tries to get away. \r  \n\r  \nThe Mig-29 wiggles the wings as a sign to anyone watching that he is there. Then again he is painted;  by enemy radar. He rolls a few times and releases decoys. \r  \n\r  \nFrom the ground we see the MIG-29 shoots out tracers, we also see a line of fire coming in from a duo of SU-35 fighters. In the cockpit we can see the tracer firefly past the cockpit, several fragments hit and penetrate the right-wing and a few master cautions go off in the cockpit. \r  \n\r  \nOn the ground, people are looking up at the fighters. Ghost gets one, people cheer, the other jet is coming in hard, fires a missile, Ghost flees and disappears with the other jet over the horizon. We hear a 20mm cannon burst and a muted explosion follows. As black smoke billows on the horizon, the onlookers are holding their breath collectively. \r  \n\r  \nA small boy drops his head and a tear rolls down his cheek, then he looks up and his eyes grow large. Over the field, approaching rapidly, about 6 metres above the deck we see the silhouette of the ghost of Kyiv, as he blasts by the frame freezes and we end up with a propaganda poster with the side profile of the MIG-29, the boy in silhouette holding a flower and cheering and the text. From the back of the jet a light-blue and yellow ribbon streak across the poster\r  \n\r  \nThe Ghost of Kiev",

      "body": "Scramble alarms go off. We see several pilots running towards the QRF hangar where a few glorious Mig-29 are being spooled up by the ground crew. We focus on one of them, climbing the lead Mig-29 painted white with greyish streaks of digi-camo. On the nose, a blue and yellow emblem is visible as well as the name of the pilot Ghost. \r  \n\r  \nA Ukrainian pilot donned a flight suit, armed with a .45 pistol under his arm in a holster so as to not interfere with the movement of his upper body. He has a helmet on, with the oxygen mask dangling from a strap. As he sits down, the MIG-29 comes to life. A couple of arms secure his straps and with a few words the pilot presses buttons and the canopy comes down as the plane starts moving forward out of the bunker. \r  \n\r  \nRoaring takeoff shot from the end of the runway and hovering outside and at an angle at the cockpit. \r  \n\r  \nWe take off and switch to a camera view of one of the air intakes to the side of the plane. We see the plane streaking to the air\r  \n\r  \nInside the cockpit, a few lights start flashing and an ominous beeping sound is made\r  \n\r  \nThe plane violently rolls left and dives, whilst popping off flares. We hear the heavy breathing of the pilot in his mask as he endures massive G-forces. \r  \n\r  \nNow the tracking radar locks on to a Russian target. The pilot screams fox-1 and again peels off, only to find another target on his targeting radar. He quickly presses a few buttons and calls fox-2.\r  \n\r  \nOne smoke plume is seen in the distance, in the foreground is a field with cows. A Russian helicopter crashes and skimps across the surface of the field. It stops in a thunderous explosion. We see one of the soldiers in the back run out, burning, finally dropping. As we pan right, we see a dot that quickly becomes bigger. In a roaring sound, caused by the afterburners the Ghost of Kyiv tries to get away. \r  \n\r  \nThe Mig-29 wiggles the wings as a sign to anyone watching that he is there. Then again he is painted;  by enemy radar. He rolls a few times and releases decoys. \r  \n\r  \nFrom the ground we see the MIG-29 shoots out tracers, we also see a line of fire coming in from a duo of SU-35 fighters. In the cockpit we can see the tracer firefly past the cockpit, several fragments hit and penetrate the right-wing and a few master cautions go off in the cockpit. \r  \n\r  \nOn the ground, people are looking up at the fighters. Ghost gets one, people cheer, the other jet is coming in hard, fires a missile, Ghost flees and disappears with the other jet over the horizon. We hear a 20mm cannon burst and a muted explosion follows. As black smoke billows on the horizon, the onlookers are holding their breath collectively. \r  \n\r  \nA small boy drops his head and a tear rolls down his cheek, then he looks up and his eyes grow large. Over the field, approaching rapidly, about 6 metres above the deck we see the silhouette of the ghost of Kyiv, as he blasts by the frame freezes and we end up with a propaganda poster with the side profile of the MIG-29, the boy in silhouette holding a flower and cheering and the text. From the back of the jet a light-blue and yellow ribbon streak across the poster\r  \n\r  \nThe Ghost of Kiev",
