They don't have enough artillery or armor to mount a sufficient counter attack to retake occupied territories, and when they eventually do get more, they'll need to protect their ground movements from air attacks. \n\nAny way you cut it, they need more air than they can get with available combloc jets. This war won't be over next week. It probably won't be over in a year from now. If the West wants Ukraine to win, they need to invest in the medium to long term. I've heard the US is short of mothballed F-16s at the moment, but they have a ton of mothballed F/A-18s and F-15s. It seems to me that investing in victory necessarily entails training Ukrainian pilots on western air frames, which will then be donated. \n\nIt will be a tragedy if we find ourselves a year down the road with the UAF no better equipped than it is now.",

After 9/11, US focus shifted to counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency, facing enemies that can barely put Toyotas in the field, much less 5th generation fighter planes. The initial production goal for the F-22, which had already been reduced when the Soviet Union collapsed, seemed like overkill in that context, and so the number of planes ordered was reduced by Congress. Development of the F-35 continued, as it was a multirole fighter that was designed for a much broader array of missions, and would be theoretically cheaper to build than the F-22.\n\nBy the time the US shifted back to prioritizing Russia/China, the F-22 production lines had all been shut down due to the US ordering far fewer planes than they initially anticipated when they set up the production lines. Given the cost to reconstitute them, the genuinely impressive performance of the F-35, and the fact that their 6th generation fighter program was well underway, it didn't make sense to try to produce any more F-22s, and instead just rely on the F-35 until the NGAD is ready to replace the existing F-22 fleet. Given the cost of restarting the F-22 production lines, the US can build 3 new F-35s for the price of a single new F-22, and quicker to boot.",

If you're going 2 vs 12, as long as you know who your copilot is, you basically just kill everything in the air. Whereas the 12 v 2 guy actually has to really worry about shooting down other Russians Jets in the air. \n\nThe contested airspace in Ukraine probably operates in a similar matter for the Ukranians. If jets are deployed in this one area, the AA systems turn off and you can rely on your jets to fight. If jets are not deployed in this area, your AA systems basically hit anything that is in the skies. The Russians on the other hand cant really do that because if they detect a Mig, there's a real risk it's going to be their own mig.",

I honestly don't know of a single person that isn't surprised just how well you can all defend your country and that alone is something to be proud of.

However, if you consider he was flying over Kiev, the main Russian target, combined with the fact that the first attack was a nation wide airstrike and Russia has a lot of jets. It is feasible that one very well trained and maybe even experienced pilot could take down 6 enemy jets. \n\nAlso, that Russia is using more modern jets is not necessarily as big of an advantage as it could be. Experience is much more valuable, knowledge of the local area can also be a benefit. History is full of stories of older geared military beating more modern geared militaries for various reasons. Experience often being a key factor. One example of the top of my head was the Belgian tankers with their old leopards 1s beating other countries with theoretically better tanks in wargames. Just because they knew their old tanks so well they pushed it to the limit and then some.\n\nRegardless if it's real or not, it's fantastic inspiration for the Ukrainians and the feeling of having a guardian angel flying over you. And at that point it doesn't matter anymore if it's real or not. If it helps those poor people live through another day, I'll happily believe with them that he's real.",

We may find out a few years from now the Ghost was a few individuals who's exploited were conveniently lumped together for a good story, maybe by the internet collective maybe straight from Kiev. \n\nThe demo man may turn out to be an accidental detonation,  so the story was adapted by moving the Russians closer than they might have been and changed the explosion from an unfortunate accident to an act of heroism. \n\nWherever you are it's all but guaranteed your history is full of such stories.",

We focus on one of them, climbing the lead Mig-29 painted white with greyish streaks of digi-camo. On the nose, a blue and yellow emblem is visible as well as the name of the pilot Ghost. \r  \n\r  \nA Ukrainian pilot donned a flight suit, armed with a .45 pistol under his arm in a holster so as to not interfere with the movement of his upper body. He has a helmet on, with the oxygen mask dangling from a strap. As he sits down, the MIG-29 comes to life. A couple of arms secure his straps and with a few words the pilot presses buttons and the canopy comes down as the plane starts moving forward out of the bunker. \r  \n\r  \nRoaring takeoff shot from the end of the runway and hovering outside and at an angle at the cockpit. \r  \n\r  \nWe take off and switch to a camera view of one of the air intakes to the side of the plane. We see the plane streaking to the air\r  \n\r  \nInside the cockpit, a few lights start flashing and an ominous beeping sound is made\r  \n\r  \nThe plane violently rolls left and dives, whilst popping off flares. We hear the heavy breathing of the pilot in his mask as he endures massive G-forces. \r  \n\r  \nNow the tracking radar locks on to a Russian target. The pilot screams fox-1 and again peels off, only to find another target on his targeting radar. He quickly presses a few buttons and calls fox-2.\r  \n\r  \nOne smoke plume is seen in the distance, in the foreground is a field with cows. A Russian helicopter crashes and skimps across the surface of the field. It stops in a thunderous explosion. We see one of the soldiers in the back run out, burning, finally dropping. As we pan right, we see a dot that quickly becomes bigger. In a roaring sound, caused by the afterburners the Ghost of Kyiv tries to get away. \r  \n\r  \nThe Mig-29 wiggles the wings as a sign to anyone watching that he is there. Then again he is painted;  by enemy radar. He rolls a few times and releases decoys. \r  \n\r  \nFrom the ground we see the MIG-29 shoots out tracers, we also see a line of fire coming in from a duo of SU-35 fighters. In the cockpit we can see the tracer firefly past the cockpit, several fragments hit and penetrate the right-wing and a few master cautions go off in the cockpit. \r  \n\r  \nOn the ground, people are looking up at the fighters. Ghost gets one, people cheer, the other jet is coming in hard, fires a missile, Ghost flees and disappears with the other jet over the horizon. We hear a 20mm cannon burst and a muted explosion follows. As black smoke billows on the horizon, the onlookers are holding their breath collectively. \r  \n\r  \nA small boy drops his head and a tear rolls down his cheek, then he looks up and his eyes grow large. Over the field, approaching rapidly, about 6 metres above the deck we see the silhouette of the ghost of Kyiv, as he blasts by the frame freezes and we end up with a propaganda poster with the side profile of the MIG-29, the boy in silhouette holding a flower and cheering and the text. From the back of the jet a light-blue and yellow ribbon streak across the poster\r  \n\r  \nThe Ghost of Kiev",

He directs your car to go, you roll past a line of tanks that you know are there to fuck shit up in your land. You might be in trouble if you get out of your car and put up a fight but otherwise they couldn't care less about you being there.  \n\n\nSimilar with how the CNN reporter, who is in Ukraine to cover the plight of Ukrainians for the outside world, was allowed by the Russians to stay with the forces as they were attacking the airport.

Things would be way crazier if they were there to kill every warm body they spot. Russia shouldn't be doing any of what they are doing but thank god they aren't doing that.\n\nWar is much slower and more awkward than how its presented to us in movies. If someone is occupying your country like this, you might be in a car and come to a traffic stop being directed by an occupying soldier. He directs your car to go, you roll past a line of tanks that you know are there to fuck shit up in your land. You might be in trouble if you get out of your car and put up a fight but otherwise they couldn't care less about you being there.  \n\n\nSimilar with how the CNN reporter, who is in Ukraine to cover the plight of Ukrainians for the outside world, was allowed by the Russians to stay with the forces as they were attacking the airport.

    "body": "Scramble alarms go off. We see several pilots running towards the QRF hangar where a few glorious Mig-29 are being spooled up by the ground crew. We focus on one of them, climbing the lead Mig-29 painted white with greyish streaks of digi-camo. On the nose, a blue and yellow emblem is visible as well as the name of the pilot Ghost. \r  \n\r  \nA Ukrainian pilot donned a flight suit, armed with a .45 pistol under his arm in a holster so as to not interfere with the movement of his upper body. He has a helmet on, with the oxygen mask dangling from a strap. As he sits down, the MIG-29 comes to life. A couple of arms secure his straps and with a few words the pilot presses buttons and the canopy comes down as the plane starts moving forward out of the bunker. \r  \n\r  \nRoaring takeoff shot from the end of the runway and hovering outside and at an angle at the cockpit. \r  \n\r  \nWe take off and switch to a camera view of one of the air intakes to the side of the plane. We see the plane streaking to the air\r  \n\r  \nInside the cockpit, a few lights start flashing and an ominous beeping sound is made\r  \n\r  \nThe plane violently rolls left and dives, whilst popping off flares. We hear the heavy breathing of the pilot in his mask as he endures massive G-forces. \r  \n\r  \nNow the tracking radar locks on to a Russian target. The pilot screams fox-1 and again peels off, only to find another target on his targeting radar. He quickly presses a few buttons and calls fox-2.\r  \n\r  \nOne smoke plume is seen in the distance, in the foreground is a field with cows. A Russian helicopter crashes and skimps across the surface of the field. It stops in a thunderous explosion. We see one of the soldiers in the back run out, burning, finally dropping. As we pan right, we see a dot that quickly becomes bigger. In a roaring sound, caused by the afterburners the Ghost of Kyiv tries to get away. \r  \n\r  \nThe Mig-29 wiggles the wings as a sign to anyone watching that he is there. Then again he is painted;  by enemy radar. He rolls a few times and releases decoys. \r  \n\r  \nFrom the ground we see the MIG-29 shoots out tracers, we also see a line of fire coming in from a duo of SU-35 fighters. In the cockpit we can see the tracer firefly past the cockpit, several fragments hit and penetrate the right-wing and a few master cautions go off in the cockpit. \r  \n\r  \nOn the ground, people are looking up at the fighters. Ghost gets one, people cheer, the other jet is coming in hard, fires a missile, Ghost flees and disappears with the other jet over the horizon. We hear a 20mm cannon burst and a muted explosion follows. As black smoke billows on the horizon, the onlookers are holding their breath collectively. \r  \n\r  \nA small boy drops his head and a tear rolls down his cheek, then he looks up and his eyes grow large. Over the field, approaching rapidly, about 6 metres above the deck we see the silhouette of the ghost of Kyiv, as he blasts by the frame freezes and we end up with a propaganda poster with the side profile of the MIG-29, the boy in silhouette holding a flower and cheering and the text. From the back of the jet a light-blue and yellow ribbon streak across the poster\r  \n\r  \nThe Ghost of Kiev",

He would be shot down really easy from long range with radar guided missile and this version has low maneuverbility compared to any Russian fighter jet that is not for training purposes. With that one on this photo he wouldn't be able to fight and win other Mig29. \nMaybe it's real and maybe not, but i know that in every battle no matter if there is or is not sonething like that we need story of someone to boost morale up. Probably Russians have something in Russia to boost their moral of soldiers and people back home and stories to lower morale of Ukrainian soldiers and people.",

He already has 16 birds of the occupier. It is said that Russian pilots are no longer afraid of Ukraine's air defenses, but are trying to the death to prevent this guy from sitting on their tails and pressing the red button on the fighter's manipulator. From where he appears, emerging from an ultra-low height behind the enemy, only the Almighty knows. But I think that the main reason is that our ace knows the terrain, the locations of obstacles and the relief of his country. To fly without fear at an altitude of several tens of meters.

Some people before the war thought it would look like American invasion of Iraq in 2003 and would end just as badly as it did for Iraqis, but its been 180 degrees different. Main reason is that here the military does not run away and surrender at first opportunity like Iraqi army did. \n\nI mean goddam there was a case of Ukrainians flying a L-39 Albatross training plane against Russian jets and trying to engage them, getting shot down in process......that didnt happen in Iraq, their pilots ran away to Iran the moment things went badly for them and cared more about their personal lives than the country.

It's similar to the stories of Soviet snipers in ww2, like Vasiliy Zaitsev. Don't get me wrong, they were actually good snipers with impressive kill counts, but they agreed to become propaganda pieces, and those numbers were.. I don't want to say inflated, but rather recredited. Insted of saying \"Zaitsev killed 10 Germans, and these other snipers killed 2, 5, 8, 1, 2, 1, 3, and 4 respectively\" you just say \"Legendary sniper Vasiliy Zaitsev killed 36 Germans\"",
