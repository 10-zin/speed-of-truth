        "selftext_preview": "I consider myself to be conservative, however I am open minded to arguments or conspiracies from both sides. Recently, I have seen a big trend in people on reddit and other platforms saying they believe the assassination attempt on Trump was staged. I will admit, after seeing the first picture of his ear, I was quite shocked to see that it almost looked untouched - however, it did look like there was a very tiny scar of some sort at the top of his ear. I tried to reason that it could be makeup at first, but wouldn't he want people to see the damage?\n\nMy question is, if Trump's assassination attempt was truly staged, how could that be pulled off? I get the reasoning for wanting to stage something like that (more engagement from the right, empathy, votes, etc.), but how could that be pulled off? Obviously, people in the crowd were shot, so bullets had to have been fired and there obviously was a shooter. But how do you fake the blood - possible blood pack behind the ear maybe? It just seems wild, almost impossible to me that this could be staged, but I am scratching my head a bit. I would like to hear thoughts from anyone who truly thinks it is fake.",

The only thing I see mentioned is his ear and the blood on his face and that’s it and due to that he wasn’t shot. I guess the people that died and were also shot never happened then\n\n",

Their theory is a second shooter from a window.\n\nBut there’s another explanation that I told from the beginning: The kid didn’t shoot to kill Trump, but he was convicted to “help” the secret service taking down “bad people” infiltrated in the crowd.\n\nIt’s been a week and we still haven’t seen any medical evidence that Trump got wounded by a bullet, and the first theory was that he got hit by a flying piece of glass from the teleprompter. In fact secret service got hurt like that, with pieces of metal and glass. \n\nTrump cut his ear knowing that the shooter wasn’t pointing at him but to the crowd. He knew what was as the plan and was prepared with a hidden knife on his right sleeve. In the speech he said that it was blood everywhere but it wasn’t, he said he had blood on his hand, but the videos showed that his hand was clean. \n\nThe angle of the shot that supposed to hurt Trumps ear must be the same that wounded the man in the torso, for that the kid must be on border right side of the roof, but his body and gun was in the center. \n\nI want to see Trumps ear and medical records. \n",

It also explains why he didn't use a scope or go for a body shot which would have been a guaranteed kill.\n\nIt explains why Trump 3 times delayed exiting the stage, for his hat, his shoe and the ridiculous pose, he knew there was only 1 shooter (who wasn't going to shoot him anyway) and he was safe (we know he's a notorious coward). If this was real, there is no way they could know if it was one or more shooters. It also explains his reaction of not looking behind him if he was looking right and got a pain on his right side, the natural thing is to turn around behind him but he knew where the shot was coming from which is why he continued looking over his right shoulder.\n\nThe shooter was shot as this ties up a loose end. I am on the fence with this but if the head or deputy of Trumps SS dies in the next few years, this will be something I will believe, especially if no one can see any difference in Trumps ear when the bandage comes off.\n\nOf course I will admit it is bollocks if I see reverse angle videos of blood coming from the ear either before he puts his hand up or a couple of seconds after.\n\nWhat actually happened if it was legit doesn't make sense to me on many levels. Neither does someone going out golfing with lots of trees and cover 24h after the event. Most people would want to stay inside if they thought they were a target.",
